e52je0r,"For your numbers, The tens of thousands that would be saved aren't innocent lives, they are soldiers. Their purpose is to fight, while The thousands of innocent people are just regular citizens. 

But I think this number is way off anyways. There are more than just thousands of innocent people that would die if she took Kings Landing using her Dragons. I think you're vastly underestimating how many people live there and would be killed in the crossfire.[Almost a Million People live in Kings Landing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1mAJK_cb1s), so Even if only 1% of the population was killed using the dragons, that would still be more like 10k innocent lives. 

Thats why its more morally right to fight a drawn out war with the Lannisters than just burn it down and take it.

I mean if you'd prefer her to be rutheless, and just take it anyways thats just your preference, but She would not be saving more lives doing so, especially truly innocent ones",1,gameofthrones,1535619226.0

e52h5h9,"Well nobody alive that knows for sure except for Bran, Sam, and Howland Reed. 

However, it isn't the craziest thing if someone, like say LittleFinger, could put it together on his own. I mean Rhaegar crowns Lyanna queen of Love and Beauty. A little while later they leave together to Dorne, whether she was kidnapped and raped or they were in love, it doesn't matter to reach the ultimate conclusion. Roberts Rebellion begins. Robert kills Rhaegar at the Trident. Ned Gets to Kings Landing finding Jaimie sitting on the throne and Elia and her children murdered, meaning the next in line would be Viserys who was at Dragonstone (meaning thats where the kingsguard should be). Ned heads off to Dorne with some friends where he fights 3 Kingsguard *who have no business being there* (unless maybe theres another heir to the throne ahead of Viserys that they're protecting?). Ned and Howland reed are the only ones that survive, and Ned rides to Starfall to return Dawn to the Daynes....and about 10 months after the whole thing began, Ned returns to the North with a baby, to see Cat who just gave birth to Robb.

Now everyone knows about how Honorable Eddard Stark was/is, and how shy he was as early as the Tourney at Harrenhal (needed his older brother Brandon to ask Ashara to dance with him), Is that really a guy that LESS than a month (honestly for the timeline the baby most likely has to be older than Robb which would mean pre-marrying Cat tbh) after marrying his wife breaks the biggest vow he's made?

e52d0zu,"Well, there is a strange resemblance in their clothes, which might actually point to Bran being the Night King. (Cersei dressed quite a lot as her father before her ""trial"" in season 6, ep. 10). The three-eyed raven says something like ""It is beautiful beneath the sea, but if you stay too long, you will drown"", but that hasn't happened as yet. I don't think Bran has been the Night King from right before that guy (a Stark, probably) was turned into him by the Children. And I think he's kind of too heroic/doesn't care enough by now to try to revenge some injustice that has been done to him thousands of years ago.

How do people say this with a straight face? 

They have proven themselves to be possibly THE WORST rulers on the show. This isn’t hyperbole. 

Jon’s stint at the Night’s Watch Commander leads to his own men murdering him. Then later in Winterfell, the North basically dismisses him for Sansa. 

Dany’s stint in Mereen was so horrendous that the city erupted into chaos and bloodshed, and the person closest to her pointed out that she wasn’t meant to be a ruler. 

They have so little experience at ruling between them, but people want to crown them the ruler of and entire nation?

Also every time Jamie fights with a sword in the show he uses a 2 handed grip almost the entire time.

e51pw78,"My serious answer is either Tyrion or Arya. Tyrion because he is a character that has gotten through life solely based on his own intelligence and has overcome everything that has stood in his way to hold him back. But at the same time, he didn't use that intelligence for evil (like Littlefinger did, for example). He used it mostly for good and genuinely tried to make Westeros a better place. Until he realized he couldn't because his sister would never have any time for him. 

&#x200B;

Arya is just my favourite because she doesn't give a fuck about anything. Even before her dad died, she was always trying to do stuff that was ""unladylike"" because she didn't care what ladies are supposed to be. She had her mind set on being a knight and she wasn't going to let ""being a lady"" get in the way of that. Then she went off and became the biggest badass in the entire show. And now, there's no fucking with her. Brienne beat the fucking Hound, and Arya can quite easily beat her. She can assume any identity she wants and be indistinguishable from the actual person. She's unstoppable. Although I do believe she will be stopped before the end of the show. Somehow and by someone. 

&#x200B;

Now my comedic answer. The two more minor character I love just because they provide some comic relief, a bunch of good oneliners, and every once in a while some actual compelling story development. The Hound and Bronn. Some of the funniest lines in the show came from these two. And they just straight up don't care what anybody thinks of them, ever. At the same time, they have had some moments where the decent side of them shone through and their characters developed nicely. The Hound had his travels with Arya where he kind of assumed this father figure role for a girl that had just lost her own father. Sure he may have captured her for the ransom, but by the end he actually seemed to like Arya and took on a duty to look after her when Brienne showed up on the scene. Bronn had his moment when Tyrion asked him to fight the Mountain in his trial by combat. I've always contended that Bronn wasn't afraid to fight the Mountain per se. Bronn has never been afraid of fighting somebody in his entire time on the show. He was on the verge of throwing down with the Hound in one episode, so why be afraid of the only person equal to the Hound in strength (maybe a bit stronger, but not much). No, I think Bronn was afraid to fight the Mountain not because it meant he might die, but because it meant Tyrion might die. Tyrion was the closest thing Bronn ever had to a friend in the show, perhaps in his entire life. Bronn was not afraid of dying, he was afraid of being the reason his friend had to die.",3,gameofthrones,1535593375.0

Fire, obsidian and Valyrian steel (I think) kills wights, but just plain old weapons will render them ineffective if used with force (like the Hound cutting one in half).

If you kill a white walker then the wights he raised will die. We don’t know for sure if the Night King is killed that all of the white walkers will shatter. Probably, but not for sure.

There is no evidence that fire kills white walkers in fact they have been pictured walking through flames totally unharmed at Hardhome.

No they captured a wight not a white walker, white walkers are the ice creatures that are powerful, wights are the zombies, wights can in fact be killed by fire. 

> Just before slaying the White Walker, Jon Snow's sword clashed with the sword of the White Walker, emitting an unusually high-pitched sound wave.

Kinda shooting yourself in the foot here buddy, you admit it was only after the sword clash that they died, the White Walker was killed and only then did his wights die. 

> White Walkers ""field"" behaves similar to an electromagnetic field

Fantasy not science.

Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow speak for your fucking self there mate.

Lol, did you not notice the whole part where Sam discovers that dragonglass is the way to kill them by seeing it in a scroll, and by killing one with dragonglass. 

> White Walkers will need to be defeated quickly and easily

It won't be quick, it won't be easy and they may never be defeated for all we know. One thing I do know is that we must use the story telling to make an educated guess as to how the WW will be defeated. They have built up the importance of both dragonglass and Valyrian steel, they have literally pointed out they have to kill the NIght King to kill the rest and sound has never been mentioned before and there is literally no evidence whatsoever other than a random thought in your head.

Your project sounds amazing! I can't wait to see it! Something that may work for you is metal clay? I've got some that I'm gearing myself up to work with (it's not cheap, so I want to understand the basics first). It's a clay that is made up of organic material and metal (you can get gold, silver, copper etc.). Because it's a clay, it can be moulded which makes it great for personalised pieces. You then leave it to dry before you fire it. Most of the clays require a kiln (unfortunately, cos they are £££), but some of the copper ones can be fired using a blowtorch - PLEASE WATCH A TUTORIAL VIDEO FIRST! I don't want to inadvertently cause you death by dracarys! The fire burns up the organic material, leaving just the metal in the shape you made. You can use silicone moulds to get shapes, so maybe look for dragon ones that could be easily connected to your shirt?

e50y27z,"I started crocheting a year ago and learned from watching people on Youtube. There are a lot of great crocheters out there who really take the time to describe and show how to make every stitch. Something like this blanket is fairly easy because it is one basic stitch repeated for the entire blanket, switching out different colors of yarn to make the pattern.

Now on Arya not being a warrior, I would say is the first sword of Bravos a worrier or an assassin. Arya has got her fighting skills more from Syrio Forel than from the Temple of Faceless.

e50uk32,"I blame Martin. This story is so vast and complex — that's what makes it so wonderful. However, adapting it was going to be a real challenge even for the completed work. Martin certainly knew — better than anyone in the entire world — the consequences of failing to finish by the deadline they'd set. I can only hope he was at least upfront with them the moment he realized he wasn't going to pull it off. And I just have to believe he gave them all the guidance humanly possible for the endgame 'cause anything short of that is just unforgivable. (And yes, I know he provided a basic outline and the actual ending. I'm talking more about making himself available to consult if they so desired.)

It's this that keeps me from being really hard on D&D on the rare occasions the show disappoints me. I just remind myself what a difficult situation they're in and then I realize just how f'king picky I'm being. Btw, people seem to forget that while they're responsible for the Dorne fiasco and Arya's stupid story in s5 (my least favorite part of the whole series) they also wrote BotB and tWoW. Those are two of the best hours in tv history but to hear some people talk, you'd think the show is just pure shit now. Grrr. 

Ok sorry. Rant over. 

TL/DR; It's Martin's fault for failing to finish the books. This was supposed to be an adaptation. It was never supposed to be finishing someone else's sprawling epic. ",1,gameofthrones,1535555717.0

In this case since Arya is high on the speed list and Jon doesn’t even appear so the rating is already skewed as if speed trumps all.  BTW how do we really know Arya is so much faster.

He needed a map we’re the north is huge and difficult to invade m, so he had to have a neck. He had to have a place for Danny to deal with totally foreign cultures, so he had to have another continent etc 

If we are to assign parallels. Then, Essos is euroasia, with Valyria and that area is old Europe. People migrated to the new world in Westeros with their religion that have priests and believe in a deity that is made of separate entities but all in one such as Christianity. While the first men had a religion of nature worship, like native Americans. On the other hand essos has the Dothraki which are like mongols. Sothoryos are a bunch of jungles so it’s like Africa. I guess bravoos is like several of the Mediterranean coastal cities where many religions and races mixed. 

Ironically, this makes the area north of the wall being Canada. 

I think there is a great degree of bias toward envisioning the north as English or Scotts because of how the show cast the characters. Yes the Starks are partially based on the Yorks. But if I am not mistaken the yorks were just an English house and had knighthoods. While the Starks don’t acknowledge this system. It would have been just as possible to portray the Starks as A Native American/ European hybrid with the wildling being purely Native American, although that may have caused political issues.

e50nb61,"> Yeah but only Jon feels that way. Arya would have killed Jaime at Walder Frey's place if she had gotten the chance.

Why would she? For all his faults, his name was explicitly never on her list the way Tywin, Cersei, and Joffrey were. Why kill him? For being a Lannister? That's like saying she would have killed Tommen for being a Lannister had she gone to King's Landing before the Twins. Hell, even her experience with the Ed Sheeran crew showed her that not all Lannister soldiers are Mountains, Ticklers, and Pollivers.

Even in her quest for revenge she tends to need a *reason* to kill people, hence why she couldn't follow orders and kill Lady Crane during her time in Braavos.

If anything, Arya keeping her eye on Jaime was her assessing him to see if he does anything to deserve a place on her list. When he doesn't do anything worth killing him for, she doesn't because that's not who she is.

Hell, even after her list grows crazy long in season four she spends enough time with someone like The Hound to start removing names down to the people who *actually* had a hand in killing people she cared about (Walder, Meryn, and Cersei even though she doesn't know Cersei wanted Joffrey to spare Ned) and The Mountain (whose brutality she saw firsthand while imprisoned in Harrenhal). Why? Because at that point in season four, Arya's still grieving her family, whereas by Season Five she's matured enough over the course of her time with The Hound for him to challenge her black-and-white way of thinking and remove names that were simply there for lying to her/betraying her trust (Beric, Thoros, the Red Woman) and names of executioners that were simply following the orders of their superiors (The Hound and Ilyn Payne). My point being that Arya doesn't kill people for no reason or as proxy for her real targets; her list is for people that have actually *done* something to her. Jaime hasn't.

> And Sansa, given her previous experiences, will plan quietly to kill him.

Again, why would she? She doesn't hate ALL Lannisters for what happened to her family (even after the Red Wedding she may be uncomfortable around Tyrion but she treats him respectfully) and he kept his word in allowing Brienne the chance to find and protect her.",1,gameofthrones,1535544482.0

>\> Really? You think her brother could've achieved what she has and lived to keep it? 

First off, the only reason Dany is alive is because of plot armor… AND THE DRAGONS. Please stop pretending that Dany is alive because of her superior intelligence or whatever… it’s ridiculous. 

>\> Of course he couldn't. 

Of course he could. He survived fifteen years in exile while shoring up political alliances in a foreign country. 

>\> She had a lot of work, personal and political, that she had to do before those dragons were big enough to scare anyone. Her brother could've never done that.

This is moronic. You’re listing things that Viserys has PROVEN he can do. And which he did for 15 YEARS! Political alliances. Personal survival. He has done these exact things SINCE DANY WAS BORN. 

>\>  In fact…

Ha! Nothing you say after this point is fact though. 

>\> You mean you think that idiot, mess of a man who was stupid enough to threaten to cut Drogo's baby out of Dany's belly, in front of the man, would be smart enough to find his way through political situations? 

If he had three dragons to create political pressure like Dany does, sure.  

And to be fair, Dany has not “found her way” through political situations either. I mean, Mereen was a complete political disaster. As has been her time at Dragonstone (i.e., first meeting with Jon.) 

>\> If someone had shown up with grown dragons, all three doing exactly what he said and presented him with an army he didn't have to make an alliance to get.....then yeah, he'd have done some damage and taken some shit. And not too long after that, someone would've likely assassinated his ass.

So practically Dany’s situation!

>\> And no, a sword isn't as threatening as dragons, but the analogy holds, since Dany's ability to control those dragons is mental and her own. It's understood to be an inexplicable thing that wasn't something all Targs had and common sense tells you that THAT magic is likely connected to the magic that keeps her from burning....which her brother didn't have either.

You’re missing the point. If Viserys had “the thing” that Dany has… the power to hatch the dragons and control them, he would certainly be able to put them to use like Dany has. That’s the thing that gives Dany her power… it’s something she was born with… not something she herself developed through training (like a proficiency in using a sword would have been.) 

>\> And no I'm not high. All battles in Essos were won predominantly by soldiers, not dragons…

Soldiers that she only has because she has dragons, but OK.

That said, Yunkai was given to her because a man had a crush on her, and Mereen was won because of a former slave’s plan. Not sure why people try and give Dany all the logistical credit here. 

>\>  and she got those soldiers through bravery and intelligence. 

Nope, got those soldiers by dragons and tricking/destroying an ignorant man. 

>\> Yes, she used Drogon as a bargaining chip while taking the Unsullied, but if she hadn't been smart enough to do that, it would've never happened. 

AND she used the dragons in a sneak attack to wipe out the majority of the slavers in the area… something that would have been impossible without the dragons. I mean, Dany HERSELF planned it out this way… the crux of the plan was the dragons. No dragons, plan doesn’t happen, on multiple fronts.  

>\> The dragons weren't big enough to take the city on their own. The Dothraki took the city back while the dragons threatened the bay, in the second war of Mereen. 

Yes, she absolutely used the dragons to wipe out her enemies. She didn’t defeat her enemies through political maneuvers… she did it using dragons.  

>\> The Dothraki who's loyalty she got WITHOUT DRAGONS PRESENT. 

Literally only has them because of a super power though… it’s not like she won them over with her intelligence or political manuevering.  

>\> The dragons helped her win, they weren't the only thing used. 

Never said they were, but they were certainly, by far, the most powerful force at her disposal. 

>\> And no, she did NOT use her dragons to take or control Meereen. She didn't use the dragons in battle in Meereen until the battle for Slaver's Bay, which was RIGHT before she left. She took Meereen without them and only used Drogon to fly away once. The entire rest of the time she was in Meereen she either couldn't control them or they were locked away, with Drogon flying wherever.

She absolutely DID. 

She took the people she thought were responsible for the Sons of the Harpies to her DRAGONS TO CONTROL THEM. 

I mean, did you miss an episode? It happened, and she did it to control Mereen… using her dragons. It’s plain as day. It’s not even an argument to be had. She so obviously did use her dragons to control Mereen.

It's the stuff that was mishandled, though, that sticks out so glaringly. I think if they would have had the contours of some of the more minor plot points, we'd be having a different conversation. 

Does that make them bad writers? Maybe, maybe not. They're working within parameters that we don't know.

e509oi9,"Hi!

I use a variety of wire and it's really not that expensive (I'm a student so I really can't afford gold/silver wire, I make do with silver plated copper, or just coloured copper at the moment).

For a viking knit like this, I used a 28 gauge (cost me £1 for a 22m roll from a large home bargains kinda place). Then I used a dowel rod (circular rod, about 1.5 cm in diameter, 30 cm long, but I don't use the whole length). I got a pack of 3 of those for £1. That's the very basic parts you'll need for wire knitting, as well as wire cutters (I pinched my brothers so I'm afraid I'm not sure on price). I'd also recommend starting with the cheap wire because you're not going to start and be good at it. It will kink, it will twist on the dowel, it will get little holes in where you haven't connected a new wire properly... this is all perfectly normal and is a great way of learning how to handle the wire!

Something else that is recommended is a draw plate, which you pull your finished knit through to make it look uniform and un-kinky. I don't actually have one as I can't afford one (they're about £10-15 each but... student), so I use the inner tube of a spool of cotton or wire - similar effect but not as good. If you have a drill you could make your own I think - it's literally a piece of wood with holes of different sizes going through it, with one side tapering in towards the hole centres to guide the knit smoothly through.

Then if you want to jazz them up you can buy beads to put in them, like I have here - they do look beautiful without beads, but I was specifically aiming for a Targaryen look! I tend to upcycle jewellery I buy from charity (thrift) stores, or pilfer my jewellery box. Every now and then I do go a bit crazy and buy some online!

No one warned me about the callouses and blisters, so I will warn you! Your hands may take a while to adapt into it. I practice every night at the moment because I'm obsessed and I now have the hands of a lumberjack.

[Here's a guide I used](https://www.instructables.com/id/Viking-weave-necklace-and-bracelet/), but to be honest, it's very easy once you get into it! If you like wire, [here's some other things I've done with it!](https://www.reddit.com/r/crafts/comments/9afbbb/after_weeks_of_practice_these_are_my_makes_im/) They're more time-consuming.

>\> And how is my point not clear? Yes, in that moment she used the dragons as a bargaining tool.

But the dragons were also clearly the crux of the attack. They began the assault. They alone gained the upper hand by clearly killing many slavers and causing mass destruction in a matter of seconds before the slaver’s could react. Hell, the slavers weren’t even capable of fighting back against the dragons. 

Even if Dany doesn’t use a dragon as a bargaining chip, the dragons themselves were clearly imperative to her attack plan. There’s just no way Jorah and her decimated band of Dothraki complete her plan the way the three dragons did. 

The dragons absolutely win her the Unsullied, in multiple ways. 

>\> But if she hadn't had them, the character is intelligent enough that if she hadn't figured out, eventually, another way to get the Unsullied, she'd have gotten another force somehow. 

I love that you have absolutely zero argument and zero evidence to back this up. She simply is not that intelligent (hence the constant need for advisors), despite this once clever act that people constantly dwell on as if it’s a sign of genius. It was one clever ruse based on a situation where she had a huge advantage... an outlier, not a pattern. 

>\> The point you seem to be making is that the dragons are the only reason she's achieved anything or ever would, when it's perfectly clear the character has the drive to achieve things without them.

Not the only reason, but the main reason.  

There are plenty of characters with drive and a some cleverness in Game of Thrones, but only one of them has three dragons, and it’s very apparent how important they are to her current situation. They completely tip the balance in her favor in any situation. Hell, she could be sitting on the Iron throne today because of them (and not because of her intelligence.)

>\> She's the dragon Queen, so yes, they are a massive part of her self-identity. But they aren't the ONLY part of it.

Right… even she recognizes how important they are to her. She knows she wouldn’t be were she is without them, but somehow some viewers miss that. 

>\> And yes, Jon DOES have superpowers..........he was risen from the dead. 

Uh, that certainly doesn’t imply that Jon has superpowers… it implies that Melisandre has super powers. 

Remember when Thoros died and the Hound tells Berric that he’s on his last life with “your Red Priest gone”? It’s the “resurrecter” that has the power to channel life… not the one who died.   

>\> But Jon has also not been trying to achieve or achieving the things she has, and he flat out wouldn't have been able to. If he hadn't died, he very likely wouldn't have ever left the Watch, no matter what happened at Winterfell and that would've been that. So, Jon has what he has because he was risen from the dead, she has much of what she has because she was able to use her dragons......but it doesn't mean that eventually, though it's mostly unlikely for Jon, that they wouldn't have achieved much of the same in different ways on their own. The substance of their characters suggests it's possible.

Look, I’m really not here to make this a comparison between Jon and Dany. It’s not even a remotely fair comparison to begin with. Dany has three dragons and a super power, and Jon is just a man with plot armor. There’s no comparison there. 

I’m just saying that the dragons have absolutely catapulted Dany to the position she is in today, and certainly would not be anywhere close to where she is (or even be alive) if it wasn’t for them. 

Let’s try this: imagine there is a pie chart with four pieces, and each piece represents how much of the piece contributed to where Dany is today, and the four pieces are: 1) Dragons, 2) Immunity to Fire, 3) Advisors 4) Dany’s persona (intelligence, drive, etc.) 

What percentage would you give each of those four aspects that make up the contributions of where she it today? Maybe this will help me get a better picture of how you think the dragons aren’t as important to her progression as her intellect.",1,gameofthrones,1535527748.0

Not every event is the same in the books and the show, this is true(edit: it is known), but *most* of the character traits/ arcs are at least similar. 

I’m not saying that this book excerpt is in any way foreshadowing what happens in the show.  The point I would argue in favor of is that GRRM was intentionally foreshadowing that Sansa will be at her peak Badassery once she returns to Winterfell. 

But, that’s basically guaranteed already.... 
She left Winterfell as a prepubescent girl with a ridiculous view of the world. She has matured into a woman who can survive because she sees the true nature of the environment she is expected to live in. 

The book quote shows us that Sansa’s character is developing to become a leader in the north. The picture from Winterfell shows that character arc coming to fruition. 

No, it’s not foreshadowing that event specifically, but it is foreshadowing the general atmosphere that Sansa will create as a leader once she regains power. ",4,gameofthrones,1535524456.0

e4zsdue,"Whoa, a lot of stuff happens in this episode!

- In the last post, I wondered if Stannis's men would admire his commitment to the cause (he's strong enough to burn his own daughter!) or be freaked out by it (HE BURNED HIS DAUGHTER) and want to leave. Seems like there was some of the latter, although I'm surprised it was the sell-swords who walked away. 

- Why did Melisandre run off, though? Just because she lost faith in the odds after hearing about the deserters?

- I would pity Stannis, being abandoned by everyone who matters to him, if it weren't for what he did to Shireen.

- Related to that, I'm obviously glad Davos wasn't around when Shireen was burned, but I do think it's kind of a cop-out (intentional on Stannis's part, of course) that he never got to confront or abandon Stannis in person. 

- ""I'll learn about history, strategy, healing... And other things. Things that will help when... when they come."" (Sam to Jon, about why he should be a Maester) This kind of makes me chuckle, because it's so meta. Yep, Sam is gonna learn all the things necessary to drive the story toward the end.

- I like that the Stannis vs. Ramsay battle was shown so succinctly. It was compelling and effective -- that visual of the armies approaching each other, from high up so that they look a bit like ants against the snow -- yet barely lasted a minute.

- Oof. That little red splat when Myranda fell... (She deserved it, though.)

- Theon is like the living embodiment of ""problematic,"" but damn if the start of his redemption doesn't get me right in the feels.

- Fuck Meryn Trant. But MAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN that scene was graphic and gross.

- Poor Myrcella, and poor Jaime. 

- I remember thinking at first that Ellaria had sacrificed herself just to kill Myrcella, and marveling at how hardcore that was. But nah, she antidote-ed up. Ah well. 

- Side note: That poison seems to be working much faster on Myrcella than it later is supposed to work on Ellaria's daughter.

- Okay, haha, seeing Emilia Clarke as Dany kinda weirded me out for a second, because a few days ago I finally watched Me Before You, in which she is endearingly doofy and modern. (Charles Dance is also in it, and even though their paths never crossed in GOT, it was still hard not to think of of them as Tywin and Dany whenever they were on screen together.) But to Emilia's credit, she's totally different as Dany versus Louisa in Me Before You. It's kinda neat to see that range in her acting. (I haven't yet seen her in the Solo movie, but it's on my to-watch list.)

- I feel like Dany's face when she sees all the Dothraki pretty much mirrors what everyone in the audience was thinking. First: ""The hell...?"" And then: ""Not this again.""

- They broke Cersei. But soon she'll put herself back together again. Meaner and badder than ever.

- There is the barest hint of a smile on that sadistic Sister's face as they scrub and shave Cersei, and it made me think of this scene as an extreme, twisted version of the common teen movie trope, Homely Outcast Gets Revenge on Popular Girl.

- You can't help but feel for Cersei, in spite of her thorough awfulness. It's a loooooooooooong, miserable walk.

- And Qyburn, I mean... Such a weirdo, but such a bizarrely caring and sympathetic weirdo. And he knows just how to cheer up Cersei. ""Ta da! I got you a Frankenguard!""

- I don't think I noticed the first time around how conflicted Olly seems to be about stabbing Jon. That definitely dovetails with /u/Dzinner24's comments about him.",5,gameofthrones,1535515184.0

e4zrhkr,"> I like how they made Jaime more paternal towards his children. Where in season 1 you get the impression that he's this dude that's just happily fucking Cersei and not having to take reponsibility for raising their children.

Well, Jaime really *couldn't* act paternal toward his children before now, lest he give away the secret. IIRC he makes comments (in S3, maybe? after Joffrey's death?) about how he couldn't have parented his kids even if he wanted to, and he just had to watch from the sidelines. I didn't get the impression that he was happy about it -- or unhappy about it either, in a way -- but that it was just something he accepted because he had to.

But with Robert out of the picture, and the secret slipping more and more into public knowledge, it gives him a bit more leeway. (Along with his own personal growth, of course.) 

> I know I know. Cersei prorably had this coming. But still the walk of atonement was pretty hard to watch and Lena Headey is just so damn good.

AGREED 110%.

> You know I really don't have the hatred that others do for Olly. He was a kid that had lost everyone close to him and didn't understand the politics of the situation. He probably in my opinion was also manuipulated by Thorne and the others.

I so very much agree with this. I mean, yes, it was shitty of him to betray Jon, the person who took him under his wing, and treated him like a little brother. But the kid is also like 10? 12? His family was brutally murdered in front of his eyes, and the other guys probably manipulated him (in the way that any ""cool"" older kids can manipulate vulnerable younger ones).",2,gameofthrones,1535514433.0

e52k1za,"> So are you saying that if enough lords agreed to call a Great Council to decide the matter Stannis would have lost his right to the throne by primogeniture? Or are you just trying to dodge the issue of whether the situation in Westeros merited a diplomatic resolution over a legal one by pointing out that these two rejected it?

Dodge it? I'm sorry, I pointed out that one of them is actually following the law and is a clear successor, meaning the Aerion scenario isn't at all the case here. You're the one arguing for ""right of I have the men to push out my older sibling"" and then going for ""but Great Councils *peacefully* making a decision in a tricky time shows my ""use violence"" approach is just fine.

>Nope. Stannis is not a clear successor.

Yeah, he kinda is. Renly knows it. The Tyrells (aside from maybe Mace and Loras) know it.

>I'm confused. I thought you were arguing that if the lords get to turn against whoever should be in power by primogeniture the whole social structure breaks down. But now you are turning around and saying that sometimes it is ok to rebel? Who gets to decide what is demonstrated tyranny?

I think you're avoiding the difference between ""I want to kick out my older sibling because I want to rule now"" and ""openly murders people who didn't do anything wrong"" (our friend Aerys II) or ""seizes lands on a whim, tortures people, and would have gotten a rebellion if not for his son being a better king that angry lords were willing to wait for, and would rebel if he disinherited that son"" (Aegon IV the Massive Waste of Flesh).

>That's always the case. But if succession was less rigid a younger brother taking power might not fear his nephews growing up to challenge him as much, and so might be less likely to resort to killing them. Or brothers will be able to agree to a joint rule. Or someone who doesn't really want to rule could just go over the narrow sea to run his mercenary company and leave ruling to someone more responsible.

Or he'd fear them even more because he knows they can legally do what he just did. We have plenty of RL examples, they're called ""I launched a coup, now I'm going to spend my time fearing another one happening"" (see Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Greece, Turkey, and virtually every other nation that's had a coup).

And joint rule really, really isn't going to work. You inevitably are going to have serious disagreements and people are going to ask the simple question ""who has the right to decide?""

>Becoming a septon, a Maester, or Watchman are all drastic. They require different things, but all of them prohibit marriage. Septonhood doesn't necessarily prohibit one from ruling either, Baelor the blessed was septon and king.

Baelor's also the only example I can think of. And given views on him, I suspect he's the reason it doesn't happen now (note the much more recent case of when Lancel joined the Warrior's Sons, he renounced his titles and lands). 

And we've seen Sam's opinions. He wanted to be a maester, his father had him chained to a *wall* for days because he wanted it.

>No, declining inheritance wouldn't work because then Dickon would need to worry about people considering primogeniture important coming along to try pushing the claim of one of Sams kids, or Sam changing his mind.

Once he's declared that he's not inheriting, that his brother is, and his brother receives those oaths of loyalty, very few people in Westeros would ever even hypothetically let Sam take that declaration back.

And no, people are not going to care about primogeniture not being followed if it's not because the younger brother is an ambitious brat, but because the older brother is choosing to step aside for the younger.

As for Sam's kids ever trying to push a claim, give them some nice, small area and make them House Tarly of Blankety Blank, branching off from House Tarly of Horn Hill. The first Tarly of Blankety refused the lordship, his children are members of the spun-off branch.

Better yet, just give him a deal that he can do whatever he likes at Horn Hill, so long as he has no children. No one who's met Sam would have any reason at all to think Sam would ever break that agreement.",1,asoiaf,1535619877.0

e52ir8g,"The thing is, and this is big, a ""condensed version"" would very likely be an incomplete and dumbed down version. This sounds unnecessarily snarky, arrogant even, but I mean it without any malice. GRRM isn't a hack and he isn't into filler. Having read his stuff beyond ASOIAF, I can attest to at least one thing about his writing and that is, the man isn't in any way writing wasted pages. People like to bring the ""fat pink mast"" and food descriptions into discussion as examples for things, that could or should be excised, but the hard truth is, these things are important. ""Fat pink mast"" is Sam's horrible body image and therefore his character work; the food stuff is about the class differences in Westeros and is about how fucked you are coming winter (Theon's Winterfell chapters already show the food shortages, this will without a doubt aggravate in the last two books). And GGRm'S strength is character work and harsh metaphors.

The first three ASOIAF novels were brillant, no question. They were fast paces thrillers, action filled and pretty smart deconstructions of fantasy clichees. AFFC and ADWD were slower, also no question, though no less clever, and way more effective in deconstructing fantasy tropes. They were denser and more direct with the themes of the series. Brienne traveling through the Riverlands spectating the horrible consequences of war isn't filler distracting from the point of the story, it is the point of the story. Arianne trying desperately not be be shut out of political power in favour of her brother isn't a storyline going nowhere, it is the point of the story. The Sparrows being a major threat to civil life in King's Landing isn't an unnecessary introduction of a new subplot, it's the point of the story. The things I have seen the most derided as ""filler"" or ""pointless"" or ""boring"" are the core of what GRRM is trying to communicate. In three words ASOIAF is about Pacifism, Feminism and Anti-Theism. And anyone, who read his other works can confirm these are the core themes of GRRM in general.

I know, this may get controversial, because i said the f-word (no, not *fuck*, the controversial one), but get this: GRRM is the author who wrote an entire novel about [a guy coming to terms with how his prefabricated images of women and his lacking sensitivity about his GF's self image fucked up his relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying_of_the_Light). The man wrote a story about a [cosmic conspiracy by telepathic aliens, that claims all religions are a deliberate lie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_Cross_and_Dragon). All the Brienne stuff of a woman in a ""man's role"", all that for some people superflous stuff about the evils of religion, all the destruction the unending cycle of war and violence, you can't excise that for a ""condensed version"", because that is, what the books are about.

A ""pacier version"" won't make him the King of fantasy literature, it would degrade him to hust another bloke writing about swords and dragons and fireballs. GRRM isn't the pretender for kingship, he is the guy telling you, that monarchy is a terrible form of government. I hope that in 50 years these ""lengthy and occasionally rambling"" books are seen as what I strongly think GRRM intended them to be, a harsh but entirely needed message about the common fantasy elements, regarding war, women's role in society and religion. And getting rid of any of the rambles would also get rid of the reason, why these books were written.

These books aren't brilliant *despite* of GRRM hitting you over the head with his philosophy, they are brilliant *because* he is hitting you over the head with his philosophy.",1,asoiaf,1535618617.0

e52hmur,"> Renly rejected the possibility and insisted on ""I'm awesome, I'm call up a big army"". Stannis at least was insisting on following the law even though he was facing an army far bigger than his.
  
So are you saying that if enough lords agreed to call a Great Council to decide the matter Stannis would have lost his right to the throne by primogeniture? Or are you just trying to dodge the issue of whether the situation in Westeros merited a diplomatic resolution over a legal one by pointing out that these two rejected it?

> Let's examine the succession situation. Clear successor to Robert
  
Nope. Stannis is not a clear successor.
  
> Once they show themselves to be so awful (which is actually what happens to Joffrey and Ramsay, and Gregor only gets away with it because Tywin finds him useful), then lords have reminded their superiors that the lords have military power and the same lords can start siding with other figures (Maegor had Jahaerys, Aegon IV had Daeron II, Aerys II had Rhaegar). Resistance and rebellion against demonstrated tyranny is, I think, something most would agree is better than the regular threat of civil war inside every single house just for power grabs.
  
I'm confused. I thought you were arguing that if the lords get to turn against whoever should be in power by primogeniture the whole social structure breaks down. But now you are turning around and saying that sometimes it *is* ok to rebel? Who gets to decide what is *demonstrated tyranny*?

> Remember, arguing for rule of force means that every single year, a lord or lady has to watch their family more than anyone else. Because every year might be the year that the uncle has the gold to hire some mercenaries, or the brother's convinced enough of the guard to side with him.
  
That's always the case. But if succession was less rigid a younger brother taking power might not fear his nephews growing up to challenge him as much, and so might be less likely to resort to killing them. Or brothers will be able to agree to a joint rule. Or someone who doesn't really want to rule could just go over the narrow sea to run his mercenary company and leave ruling to someone more responsible.
  
> There were other options. Sam could join the septons, a decent enough life. He could join the maesters, a life he'd probably love. He could probably decline inheritance, there doesn't seem to be a law that says you have to take the inheritance regardless of whether you want it or not.
  
Becoming a septon, a Maester, or Watchman are all drastic. They require different things, but all of them prohibit marriage. Septonhood doesn't necessarily prohibit one from ruling either, Baelor the blessed was septon and king.

Without any means to support the wildlings Jon should've let them fend for themselves, not feed them and so condemn his own men who as brothers were actually entitled to the food.

>The helm he left upon its hook. **The narrow eye slit limited his vision**, and he needed to be able to see for what was to come. **The halls of the pyramid were dark at night, and foes could come at you from either side. Besides, though the ornate dragon's wings that adorned the helm were splendid to look upon, they could too easily catch a sword or axe. He would leave them for his next tourney** if the Seven should grant him one.

It's eye slit is too narrow. It makes seeing in the dark difficult. It lessens the peripheral vision. It's wings can easily catch a blade. It's good for a tourney.

Of course, this is the complete opposite of what Barristan is facing. Barristan is charging for specific targets, he needs to see them. Barristan is attacking at dawn which means the light won't be at its best. Barristan will be in the front line where he'll have foes all around him. Barristan's foes will often have blades. Barristan is in battle, not tourney.

Barristan is impractically wearing this helm because it's from Dany, just like he's impractically doing other things because they're from or are Dany's. One does have to wonder if the betrayal of his warrior instincts, which have kept him alive and to his former and still mighty skill level, might hit a breaking point in the coming battle.

Truthfully, anyone else would have been a better king - Ned or the Lannisters. Hell, even Moon Boy for all I know.

With Lyanna dead, Robert stopped caring about anything, basically lost his will to fight or even live. So he just trusted his advisors to run the kingdom on his behalf, which meant that they all kept up the illusion of prosperity and peace, but they were fighting secret battles amongst themselves all along. He picked the worst people possible to support him, with the exception of Barristan and possibly Varys.

Renly rejected the possibility and insisted on ""I'm awesome, I'm call up a big army"". Stannis at least was insisting on following the law even though he was facing an army far bigger than his.

>As you accept there are situations where primogeniture shouldn't apply it becomes a matter of when should it not apply, and why the state Westeros was in after Roberts death doesn't qualify.

Let's examine the succession situation. Clear successor to Robert (besides Stannis' proclamation we have Catelyn backing him, which would carry weight if widely published, and Renly's original plans for Margaery only make sense if he knew the truth) who isn't an infant, he's a proven military ability, and isn't associated with assault, maiming, and insanity leading to death. It's not an Aerion situation.

That's why Ned Stark never saw it in terms of contested succession. He knew exactly who was supposed to be king and acted according to that knowledge. In fact, if not for some bad fortune in AGOT and a single bad choice by Ned, it'd have been North, Riverlands, and probably all of the Stormlands behind Stannis.

>How exactly is that worse than everyone just rolling over when the firstborn happens to be a Joffrey, Gregor, or Ramsay? And if you're about to say that those are uncommon, well there are plentiful examples of loving younger brothers who wouldn't attempt to usurp power.

1. Because typically you don't get absolute scum any more than you typically get geniuses.

2. Once they show themselves to be so awful (which is actually what happens to Joffrey and Ramsay, and Gregor only gets away with it because Tywin finds him useful), *then* lords have reminded their superiors that the lords have military power and the same lords can start siding with other figures (Maegor had Jahaerys, Aegon IV had Daeron II, Aerys II had Rhaegar). Resistance and rebellion against demonstrated tyranny is, I think, something most would agree is better than the regular threat of civil war inside every single house just for power grabs.
 
Remember, arguing for rule of force means that every single year, a lord or lady has to watch their family more than anyone else. Because every year might be the year that the uncle has the gold to hire some mercenaries, or the brother's convinced enough of the guard to side with him.

>Then there's also cases like Sam, where if the inheritance was more flexible the heir could be changed without such a drastic measure.

There were other options. Sam could join the septons, a decent enough life. He could join the maesters, a life he'd probably love. He could probably decline inheritance, there doesn't seem to be a law that says you have to take the inheritance regardless of whether you want it or not.

The reason why Sam was forced to join the NW or be murdered is because his father is really so awful a person that he can't handle the idea of a Tarly son who's a noncombatant and/or a very respected kind of servant. If Sam exists, then according to Randyll he can't be septon, maester, or guy who's around Horn Hill. He *has* to be some kind of fighter, or dead.",1,asoiaf,1535612193.0
e52c16x,"Where are you getting this impression from with Jon and Robert's small council? There were a grand total of 0 Lannisters on Robert's small council under Jon. The only issue I can say that he had was having Pycelle as his Grand Maester.

You're wrong on a lot of counts and I hate to tell you this. Baelish didn't cook the books to get the Lannisters in power. He cooked the books to throw the realm into disarray and played the long con where he was going to eventually be Lord of the Vale then find his way onto the Iron Throne by marrying the Vale to the North. He would have two major houses beneath him and all he had to do at that time was make a few more alliances. Baelish never acted with the interest of the Lannisters. It was his own. 

The Small Council beneath Robert during Jon Arryn was: Stannis, Renly, Varys, Barristan Selmy, Pycelle and Baelish. Of the those 7 only 2 of them might possibly be considered Lannister men. And even then, Baelish was acting in his own best interest. Remember everything they said about the King eating and the Hand shitting. It was Jon Arryn who kept Bobby B's peace for all those years. 

Think about Robert's rule and Jon beneath him. They had, the Stormlands, the Vale, the North, the Riverlands and Casterly Rock all allied with Robert at the time. That was 5 of the 7 Kingdoms represented at Robert's court in some way without having any of the Lannisters in a position of any power on the small council. Jon kept the peace with Dorne even after it was heavily rumored the Lannisters, the king's in-laws, killed their daughter and her children during the rebellion. He also realized that keeping Dorne pacified, but still not happy with the current ruling party, made the Reach automatically allied with those other 5 major houses. 

Jon's work as hand kept peace for the kingdom for 15 years. Robert just wanted to drink and whore and hunt and that is what he did. 

Also, it was Jon who *figured out* the children were born of incest. How was he supposed to stop that from happening? Have Cersei, the Queen, followed? Make her wear a chastity belt?

Varys has never in his entire career in King's Landing been working for the Lannisters. Nor did he set into motion the events that ended with Bobby B dying. He did passively sit back and let it all happen, but I'm going to say the reason why he did so is because he saw the eventual downfall of the Kingdom beneath Robert and the Lannisters. I'm guessing he saw Jon Arryn's death for getting too nosy and that would be the end of Robert ruling peacefully because the Lannister's would poach power and use it to exact every last cruel or petty grudge they had, throwing the country back into war. 

I'd say if anything Varys purposely did his job as terribly as possible, only feeding Robert and Jon the whispers about Viserys and Dany to pacify that he was doing his job.

Also, when it comes to ranking Hand's I'd say Jon's work destroys Ned's any day of the week. All Ned had to do was side with Renly and he could have kept his head.",1,asoiaf,1535612021.0

e52bwgv,"Great writeup! I love your model of replicating the ""Westerosi Maester Model"" with a fleet of ships instead of ravens. That would certainly explain why Arya was able to get passage back to Braavos with the iron coin: if the whole Braavosi fleet is an instrument of the HBW, then any Braavosi abroad could expect to be aware that an iron coin paired with the FM's motto is code for being pressed into the service of a global assassination machine. Great stuff!

There is, however, one big thing I'll disagree with you on: **motive**.

Having spent a lot of time analyzing the FM myself, I think the fan wisdom on the FM's transactional / profit-oriented motivations are wholly incorrect. In fact, I think the entire concept of the FM as a ""guild of professional assassins"" is just a smokescreen that the FM perpetuate as a propaganda tool and cover for their ***real*** role as covert and political operators.

Just look at Arya's training: they're not just training her to fight and kill, but also to look, to watch, to listen. To *see* the world the way it really is. To collect information, using all of her senses. They're teaching her to report pertinent information to the Faceless Men. They're teaching her how to lie, effortlessly and undetectably. What better attributes could one want in a spy?** In fact, I would go so far as to say that it's patently obvious that the Faceless Men are a politically-active organization.** The real question is to what extent, and to what ends. Braavos doesn't seem to be interested in empire-building, so what exactly are they trying to accomplish? 

What makes this question even more interesting is the Moon Singers, who are Braavos' answer to the Greenseers, Dosh Khaleen, Warlocks, and other groups or individuals that can see into the future. If the Faceless Men have access to fortune-tellers, what sorts of interventions might they look to make to influence the timeline?

For example: might a Faceless Man seek to intervene to kill a sleeping child in his bed, before he can become an all-powerful Greenseer?

Might a Faceless Man try to sabotage an attempt by a Targaryen King to bring about a return of dragons, and resolidify their grip over Westeros?",3,asoiaf,1535611899.0

Whatever Rhaegar charged him with doesn't mean much to me (if he even did; his last meeting with Jaime bore no mention of the family he was apparently so concerned for) considering the situation he was in. The lives of millions were at stake, it wasn't the best mindset to be in afterwards and like he said, he thought he had taken care of the danger in Aerys, not expecting Tywin to hurt them. He is one man, I don't know how he has to have to responsibility of everything and everyone on his shoulders because of the choices others made.

You speak of what he sworn to do, that was protect Aerys. When that vow went up in flames, I'm not sure how we're to hold him to any other assumed oaths. He literally killed his king, those promises stopped counting. Yet still he didn't throw the kids at Tywin's feet and wash his hands of their safety, he didn't think they were in danger.

e527y3i,"> Also, Bran asked BR point blank if he’s the Three Eyed Crow and BR answers in the same confused way as Sam of fucking horn hill... I am equally sure both are not the three eyed crow. 

I mostly agree with you.  Remember that I said ""**I'm aware that there is other evidence that Bloodraven is not the Three-Eyed Crow, but you can't say that with certainty**"".  I will not say with certainty - because in my opinion *there is insufficient evidence to be certain* \- that Bloodraven is not the 3EC, but it's definitely within the realm of possibility.

I'm just making the claim that the piece of evidence you offered is not a good enough.  See below: 

> And the quote about talking through dreams is not out of context at all, it is the only time Bloodraven ever speaks about talking through a dream... and I am not alone in believing his half sister, the woman he loved, Shiera Seastar is still alive (aka he’s not talking back in time, just trying to reach her at all). 

He doesn't speak about talking through a dream, though.  Here's the original quote:  

>**""But,"" said Bran, ""he heard me.""**  
>  
>**""He heard a whisper on the wind, a rustling amongst the leaves. You cannot speak to him, try as you might. I know. I have my own ghosts, Bran. A brother that I loved, a brother that I hated, a woman I desired. Through the trees, I see them still, but no word of mine has ever reached them. The past remains the past. We can learn from it, but we cannot change it.""**

No mention of dreams; repeated mentions of the past.

And it's a fairly weak argument, in my opinion, to premise the idea that Bloodraven cannot communicate to the living with the idea that Shiera Seastar is alive.  If anything, by grouping her with the most likely dead Ned Stark, Bittersteel, and Daeron (or, for extra fun, Daemon), Bloodraven hints that he does not believe her to be alive.

\---

Anyway, with that out of the way: 

>There is no evidence Bloodraven was not a claimant. We have no actual textual evidence either way.

The null hypothesis, in my opinion, is what's in the text: that the main claimants at the Great Council of 233 were Vaella (Daeron's daughter), Maegor (Aerion's son), and Aegon, with Aemon as an outside claim.  This is stated by Jeor Mormont, a close friend of Maester Aemon for decades: 

>**First they offered it, quietly, to Aemon. And quietly he refused. The gods meant for him to serve, not to rule, he told them. He had sworn a vow and would not break it, though the High Septon himself offered to absolve him. Well, no sane man wanted any blood of Aerion's on the throne, and Daeron's girl was a lackwit besides being female, so they had no choice but to turn to Aemon's younger brother—Aegon**   
>  
>Jon I - ACOK

This is corroborated by the WoIaF, which you dismiss as ""rough and inaccurate"".  It's purposefully biased, yes, but that's part of the story.  What motivation does Yandel have to hide?

>How could he not have been... he was a legitimized son of Aegon the Unworthy.

He's only a claimant if he makes a claim.  In my opinion, the burden of proof lies with the person who claims that there is a secret claimant erased from historical record.

>It sure seems to me that Bloodraven did try...

I'm not convinced, still.  There's just insufficient evidene.  Kyle the Cat hypothesizing that Bloodraven would wage bloody war against Maekar and Bloodraven not denying it is relatively moot, as we know historically that *this didn't happen*.",3,asoiaf,1535608273.0

Sorry, let me clarify: I was specifically speaking of pre-series Hand Tywin, back when Rhaegar was alive and when Tywin and Aerys II were friends. IF World is a true telling (I assume it's *mostly* true in-universe), Tywin was a very capable Hand to Aerys, basically running the kingdom (and why Aerys II later got paranoid: Tywin was ""too good"").

Post-AGOT's Jon/Ned being Hand, Tywin entrusted Tyrion as hand, then Tywin had to deal with not only Joff, but Cersei and other BS and *imo* didn't really have much time as Hand to *tell* how he would have functioned. (Good battle commander though.) I'd still give Tywin the nod based on his Hand term during AerysII, but yeah Tywin trusted LF without knowing LF too well yet, and then Tywin got killed.

Re: Varys, I'm a bit with AGOT Ned on *at least* Jaime hanging around, but I'd stretch it to Varys because ""the tales"" were that Varys had Aerys' ear. At least Jaime ran Aerys through, but the ""holdovers"" who may have influenced Aerys II in his burnings and stuff? **Nah.** Personally I love Varys as a character, but it just doesn't make sense to keep that spooky of a guy around unless Jon knew something about Varys that others didn't.

And that's possible. AND it's why I think there's more yet to be told about Jon Arryn's story. He's just too BIG OF A CHARACTER whose death, as you say, basically set off the Wot5K.

That's just for the sake of fantasy, Tyrion didn't kill many knights, only one I believe. It wasn't *through* the head lol, it was just beneath the skin, it's been explained several times in the books, he didn't get his head chopped in half.

The Wildlings were sure as hell not expecting another army, they were beyond the wall and the Nights Watch only had like 600 men left at the time.

Theon captured an undefended Winterfell after he was let into the castle, they didn't know that he had turned against him. Daenerys point is fair I guess, but Tyrion did the same exact thing in the show. Tyrion had a lot to deal with at the time and Littlefinger was their only source of money.

> It'd have been Aerion's son, Maegor, but he was an infant at a time when civil war, famine, and plague were dangerously real in Westeros, and Aerion managed to be so spectacularly bad at being a prince that no one wanted to risk his son being the same. And when I say he was bad, please remember that Aerion was the guy who deliberately maimed opponents at jousts, assaulted commoners for doing nothing wrong, was the cause of the trial that Prince Baelor died in, named his son after one of the worst kings the Targaryens ever produced, and was so insane he drank wildfire to turn into a dragon (narrator: it didn't work).
  
As you accept there are situations where primogeniture shouldn't apply it becomes a matter of when should it not apply, and why the state Westeros was in after Roberts death doesn't qualify.
  
> And no, the idea of might = getting to push other members of family aside absolutely isn't on the same level as primogeniture, not unless you happen to like the idea of Westerosi lords forced to constantly go after their own families out of fear of their younger siblings and there always being threat of private wars across Westeros. Primogeniture sucks. It at least has a peaceful rule for who gets to rule.

In Spain his full name would've been: Harrold Hardyng Waynwood.
And his mother's (let's call her Theresa): Theresa Waynwood **Arryn**.

That's why Harry is an Arryn, a descendant of Lord Jasper Arryn (Jon's father) though matrilineal side.

In some place of Europe they had this:

> Majorat (French: [ma.ʒɔ.ʁa]) is a French term for an arrangement giving the right of succession to a specific parcel of property associated with a title of nobility to a single heir, based on male primogeniture. A majorat (fideicommis) would be inherited by the oldest son, or if there was no son, the nearest relative. This law existed in some European countries and was designed to prevent the distribution of wealthy estates between many members of the family, thus weakening their position. Majorats were one of the factors easing the evolution of aristocracy. The term is not used of English inheritances, where the concept was actually the norm, in the form of entails or fee tails. Majorats were specifically regulated by French law. In France, it was a title of property, landed or funded, attached to a title instituted by Napoleon I and abolished 1848. **WIKIPEDIA**

If the closest relative wanted to inherent he had to change his surname too. And when it was a woman, her children had her surname, not her husbands.

Other than LF's scheming, which honestly is above a level anyone could deal with, what power grabs were there? Barristen, Renly, Arryn, and Stannis might have butted heads on things, but as far as were told they did their jobs well and werent grabbing power.

And as for the Starks and Lannisters? Bad blood sure, but they hadn't started butting heads until Arryn's death when Robert visited Winterfell and Bran got tossed out of a window by Jaime. They weren't involved with each other basically at all, beef was more or less squashed, and were even allies against Balon.

e5211f9,"Alright it was supposed to be tongue-in-cheek because obviously Ned won’t fight in the upcoming war. I don’t think he’s actively working against his family, but his decisions do.

 He’s been protecting a Targaryen his whole life, a risk to his whole family (he could have just left Jon in Dorne. Everyone thinks it’s his bastard and Robert left bastards across the seven kingdoms). He tells Cersei to get her children out of KL, before he even gets his own children out. Ned’s whole code of honor was based on justice. Incest is against the laws of old god and new. If Ned was about justice he should have told Robert. 

Everyone thinks Sansa lives in a fairytale in AGOT, but it’s really Ned. He thinks he’s in the Hour of the Wolf 2.0, where he can just come to KL, solve everything, and then turn around. I think he subconsciously wants to be the hero, despite telling everyone he doesn’t. Like I said it was a silly comment and I still like Ned, but he never considered the immediate safety of his family when making decisions.

Rhaegar became so obsessed with a prophecy to save the kingdom, that he plunged it into war, killing thousands including his own family. 

So yes, I do think that Rhaegar was absolutely out of his mind to do what he did, and Lyanna was probably caught up in the whirlwind romance of it all. But again, I think that's all just to illustrate how prophecy can be more harm than good.

*""You have forgotten Prince Rhaegel, my friend,"" Ser Maynard objected, in a mild tone. ""He comes next in line to Aerys, not Maekar, and his children after him.""*
**""Rhaegel is feeble-minded. Why, I bear him no ill will, but the man is good as dead, and those twins of his as well, though whether they will die of Maekar's mace or Bloodraven's spells…""** *Seven save us, Dunk thought as Egg spoke up shrill and loud. ""Prince Maekar is Prince Rhaegel's brother. He loves him well. He'd never do harm to him or his.""*

This is a conversation between Kyle the Cat and Maynard Plumm (Bloodraven).

And then the WoIaF tells us:

*His brother Rhaegel, third son of Daeron the Good, had predeceased him, choking to death upon a lamprey pie in 215 AC during a feast.*
*Rhaegel's son, Aelor, then became the new Prince of Dragonstone and heir to the throne, only to die two years after, slain in a grotesque mishap by the hand of his own twin sister and wife, Aelora, under circumstances that left her mad with grief.

How could he not have been... he was a legitimized son of Aegon the Unworthy.

It sure seems to me that Bloodraven did try... but he was almost universally despised, and for good reason. He ruled in all but name in what amounts to a reign of terror, literally hanging dissenting voices from cages on the road side, sending starving peasants back to droughts land to starve, and ruthlessly punishing anyone who stood up to him.

And the quote about talking through dreams is not out of context at all, it is the only time Bloodraven ever speaks about talking through a dream... and I am not alone in believing his half sister, the woman he loved, Shiera Seastar is still alive (aka he’s not talking back in time, just trying to reach her at all).

I also agree that she's going to turn the tables on Littlefinger and become a player herself, but that wouldn't really make her qualified to be queen. Like I said, there're other characters that had to deal with ruling and it's very hard, it takes time, they make a ton of mistakes, they have to make very difficult choices and face the consecuences.

He wasn't even a claimant for the Iron Throne then, and he had ample opportunity to press any claim.  He was Hand of the King, and so he essentially ruled the realm already.  He killed Aenys Blackfyre.  The lords offered a crown to Aemon Targaryen, *a maester who took solemn vows to wear no crowns and give up his family*, going as far as having the High Septon offer to absolve those vows, in order to keep Aegon out of power.

If Bloodraven had *any* ambition to be king himself, that was the perfect opportunity.  There is no evidence that he tried, though, and it would have worked had he tried: Bloodraven was feared, a renowned warrior, and fought with Dark Sister, an ancient Targaryen relic.  Aegon V was half a peasant himself, in the lords' eyes.  It wouldn't have been *legal*, per se, but that's the purpose of Great Councils.

This is *possible*, and I'm aware that there is other evidence that Bloodraven is not the Three-Eyed Crow, but you can't say that with certainty.  The evidence you cite here is out-of-context.  He tells Bran that he's tried to speak with his own ghosts - a brother he loved, a brother he hated, a woman he loved, etc. - *right after Bran tries to speak to Ned in the godswood.*  His point is that one can't communicate with the past.

But Tywin *did* allow Littlefinger to run amok.  Not only did Littlefinger continue to serve as Master of Coin, he was later awarded Harrenhal and the Riverlands.

> Why'd he keep Varys on?

Varys was an accomplished and skilled spymaster with a well-established network of informants not only in King's Landing but in Essos.  He was brought to Westeros from the Free Cities, meaning he is unconnected politically to most of Westeros, making him more likely to be a neutral party (why should it make a difference if he serves King Aerys or King Robert?)

> Arryn's book role doesn't make a lot of sense to me. 

Arryn's death brought about the War of the Five Kings.  That was his role.  It brought the royal court to the North, resulting in a crippled Bran and the catspaw incident, which led to the kidnapping of Tyrion and the subsequent burning of the Riverlands.

It also brought Ned south, leading to his execution, bringing the North into the war.  His investigations into the legitimacy of Cersei's children revealed their true heritage, inciting Stannis to make his claim for the Iron Throne, while Renly first sought to remove Cersei and her children and bring House Tyrell to power before rebelling himself.

Lyanna was in a small tower in the middle of nowhere carrying Rhaegar's child, it makes sense that she would be with the more experienced kingsguard since those were the only people with her. Elia and their children were in the Red Keep protected by thousands of knights and soldiers and there wasn't any immediate threat to them at the time aside from Aerys, which is what I think Rhaegar was mainly referring to.

Rhaegar told Jaime that after he returned from battle that ""changes would be made"", insinuating he would depose his mad father.

There was no reason for him to guard the throne, he sat on it because he was an arrogant ass that wanted to see who would take it while Lannister soldiers sacked the city he killed the king for. He was still a kingsguard and was told by Rhaegar to protect his wife and children, and he left them to Tywin Lannister's mercy. There was no way he could have thought that the children would survive.

>And maybe he should've, maybe his oversight damned them but I personally can't blame him for their deaths when it wasn't his actions that put them there

e51ux8k,"Let's see:

1. That needed the buy-in (note: the political meaning, not business) of the major lords of the realm. Heck, the council was called specifically to get that special buy-in to make it clear whoever was chosen really was king and people couldn't complain about legitimacy.

2. Great Councils are called for tricky succession questions when the regular rules might not work because of the serious political issues of the time.

3. It'd have been Aerion's son, Maegor, but he was an infant at a time when civil war, famine, and plague were dangerously real in Westeros, and Aerion managed to be so spectacularly bad at being a prince that *no one* wanted to risk his son being the same. And when I say he was bad, please remember that Aerion was the guy who deliberately maimed opponents at jousts, assaulted commoners for doing nothing wrong, was the cause of the trial that Prince Baelor died in, named his son after one of the worst kings the Targaryens ever produced, and was so insane he drank wildfire to turn into a dragon (narrator: it didn't work).

In summary, Great Councils are there to handle these issues, they're to replace the legitimacy of being the clear firstborn with the legitimacy of having the express consent of the governed, and the reason they needed one was because not even primogeniture rules could overcome massive security concerns and how horrible Aerion was. So Aegon V does not say it's all rubbish.

And the idea of might = getting to push other members of family aside absolutely isn't on the same level as primogeniture, not unless you happen to like the idea of Westerosi lords forced to constantly go after their own families out of fear of their younger siblings and there always being threat of private wars across Westeros.

e51uvvr,"As controversial as his decisions were, Jon made more progress than most of the previous lord commanders. He made the wildlings work for the Night's Watch, bulking up their ranks. He used them and his fellow brothers to man and refurbish several of the vacant castles along the Wall. And he set up a deal with the Iron Bank to fund the Watch. Rigidly sticking to the status quo is half the reason why the Night's Watch is in such a dismal state.

And Jon was smart enough to ultimately realize that, for all the NW's isolationist leanings, they've lost sight of their mission to defend the *realms* of men and not just themselves; in his last chapter, the Boltons appear to present an even greater threat to the NW and the realms of men than even the wildlings. In any case, there's no way the NW could remain neutral from the Seven Kingdoms after accepting help from Stannis and sheltering his army. Nor should they. They would never be able to defeat the Others or preserve themselves without help from outside forces.

The mutineers are cowardly and close-minded. If they were smart, they would have just let Jon and the wildlings (both of whom they want gone) go off on their suicide mission.

e51ueq3,">The Economy: Things were prosperous under King Robert’s reign. However due to hints here and there I honestly think that this was a false prosperity organized by Littlefinger who was secretly bankrupting the kingdom. Tyrion notices that the books are off and he was Hand for a very short period of time, how did Jon Arryn not notice this in his 14 years?

>The Economy: I already covered this earlier but Littlefinger pretty much set the economy on the road to ruin under Jon’s watch.

This is a show-only thing. In the books Tyrion finds that Littlefinger was a good Master of Coin who found lowborn-but-talented people to work in financial positions and multiplied the kingdom's wealth by both legal and illegal means(Though he also enriched himself while he was at it). In fact Jon Arryn appointed Littlefinger as Master of Coin because he was impressed with his work in a minor post he had given to Peter as a favour to Lysa.

>The incest: I can’t remember if it was Stannis or Jon who first started suspecting that Cersei’s children were not Robert’s but either way, Jon helped to discover the truth and would probably have told Robert

I'm surprised it took Jon 17 years to find out. Other than that he handled it the same way Ned did.

>Allowing Lannisters to infest the court. Robert didn’t give a monkey’s behind but Jon should have noticed the danger in letting Cersei infest the court with Lannisters. Yes Stannis and Renly were on the council but it appears that the men at arms and the gold cloaks were more loyal to Cersei and Littlefinger, than Robert. Why wasn’t a Stormlander put in charge of the gold cloaks?

The kingdom was already in debt by the end of Aerys' reign; I imagine this may have been a factor in Jon negotiating the alliance with the Lannisters. The debt to Casterly Rock kept mounting under Robert's reign; that would have given Cersei and Tywin more power over time. 

I agree it was a failure of Jon to not have sought better royal ties with Highgarden instead.

To save the city, to slay Aerys, to kill the pyromancers, to guard the throne. Aerys was the true threat, he never expected his father to hurt them or he would've been there.

Bloodraven doesn’t mind-control other people. He can speak to greenseers in their dreams/visions but he can’t command them.

When he reached the wall he became Lord Commander, his concerns were focused up north. If he did care about southern politics there wasn’t anything he could do about it.

When he went to the cave his concerns became defeating the Others, the squabbles among Targ factions didn’t matter anymore.

More broadly, the books are about what choices someone makes in difficult situations, if Bran or Bloodraven were mind-controlling everyone it robs people of their agency. Bran controlling Hodor is an example of it being a horrible thing to do that results in tragedy and ruined lives, not a way to get things done.

Aerys was nuts because he was nuts and the Westerosi feudal system sucks because there's no efficient way to safely remove a destructive king.  Aegon V tried to hatch dragons because his power base was being eroded and he thought if he had dragons he could make the restless high lords bend to his will.

I really don't know where you are getting that Jon is bias towards Stamina and his family, he doesn't like Robert, doesn't know Renly, dislikes  Celysse, mistrusts Melisandra, and the King & Queen's Men. Now he may like Stannis as a person but he still defied his orders when it best suited the Watch's insterests. And even though he likes Tormund he still took the necessary precautions to ensure the Wildings wouldn't rebel immediately after crossing the Wall.


His only major mistake as Lord Commander was to pursue his personal vendetta against the Boltons. Other than that every other decision he made was 100% logical.

e51rqov,"> In regards to the Origins of the warg gene within the Starks, I think this theory is more interesting and plausible than stark wedding a daughter of magical animal race (I bet the transfer of warg kings blood to the weirwood was super valuable)

Have you read GRRM's *Thousand Worlds* stories? If not, Preston Jacobs does a good primer on them with his ""Thousand Worlds Book Club."" I only agree with about 60% of his analysis on them, but he nevertheless highlights a lot of the extraordinary insights these books give us into the workings of GRRM's mind.

What's most important, I think, is that the ***rules*** of the *Thousand Worlds* interact almost perfectly with those of ASOIAF. There are also some really interesting clues buried in TWOIAF that suggest that ASOIAF may have a scifi origin story, which makes all kinds of interesting connections possible. Not to mention that the *Thousand Worlds* is basically a proto-ASOIAF, with all *sorts* of mechanics, themes, and other elements that have been recycled straight into ASOIAF.

The two of these that are most pertinent are genetic engineering, particularly of humans, as well as telepathy. 

In one of the *Thousand Worlds* stories [SPOILER](/s 'the *Plague Star*, which is the first story in the series of stories collected in *Tuf Voyaging*'), there is a collection of cloned apex predators that have been genetically engineered to be essentially remote-controlled telepathically. I think this is the foundational element that GRRM created ASOIAF around, and since we know that the scene of the Starks finding the direwolf pups hidden amidst the summer snow was the scene that GRRM built ASOIAF around, I don't think it's at all outlandish to think that the direwolves are conceived along the same vein.

Additionally, a lot of GRRM's stories include human enhancement and bioengineering. I think that GRRM conceived of ASOIAF as a world ruled by bioengineered humans, which is a theme he explored before in *In the House of the Worm*. Certain bloodlines contained powers like warging or controlling dragons, and those bloodlines came to be politically dominant as a result. 

> If we imagine this “spirit” power as a collecting battery, 1) only emptyable from burning or cutting down the weirwoods... or 2) dispersing charges from an overloaded spirit tree could result in physical manifest or “birth” of spirit power in human form

I think there's a third option: that each ""battery"" can connect with a ""Speaker,"" who is able to channel those powers and interact with the outside world on the collective's behalf. In this way, these ""spirit batteries"" become a sort of analogue for the society, embodying both collective knowledge as well as the tribalism and base emotions of the masses.

GRRM has done this before as well, in both *A Song for Lya* and *And Seven Times Never Kill Man*, both of which involve interactions with collective consciousnesses that interact with the world through a ""Speaker."" One of the Tuf Voyaging stories, *The Guardians*, is the same.

In ASOIAF, we have Bloodraven as such a speaker, acting as the living creature through which the Weirwoods interact with the world. However, I believe there are others like it, most notably the Shrouded Lord and whatever is manifesting as R'hllor. I also have a sneaking suspicion that the Others a collective of some sort, though there's not enough information to speculate on how the exact mechanics of that work.

> This could give a logical explanation as to why the Children went to War when they found out the trees were getting burned/cut down. The trees are valuable resources, slowly collecting power over the centuries

They're not *just* a spirit battery, though. They're also a collective consciousness, likely capable of rational thought and forming its own objectives. The issue (which GRRM explored in *Guardians*), is that collective consciousnesses don't necessarily have a way to interact with the outside world if they're simply a collection of minds ""dissolved"" into some kind of psychic medium. They need a *tool* to interact with the outside world, which is why GRRM has previously used ""speakers"" to engage with the world on their behalf.

However, *The Guardians* is a SUPER interesting case study on this, as in that story there is a collective consciousness that can control massive seamonsters, and bioengineer them to face new threats. A similar thing happens in *The Men of Greywater Station*, where a remote research centre learns that the planet they're on is a conscious living organism that begins to attack them like a body fighting off an infection.

This is kind of where my theory about the others comes in. I don't think the Others are just slave soldiers created by the Children: I think they're slave soldiers created by the Children **on behalf of the Weirwoods, designed to interface directly with the trees**.",1,asoiaf,1535594887.0

e51p5l8,"Sansa is quite a strecht, you're right, but one of her masters is Cersei. She does not follows her but learns what NOT to do. Moreover, she is the one more acquainted with courtesy. Courtesy is not to be respectful, but to follow certain rules that were highly regarded in medieval courts, even the ""courtly love"" followed rules of courtesy. That's why Sansa has an intuitive ability to know what others are and desire, and she acts on it. It's not to know who is Barristan, for example, but to know who is him and act in accordance. In King's Landing she used courtesy as an armor, along Littlefinger, she is learning to use it as a weapon.
In hre Middle Ages, courtesy is one of the things kings and queens learned since they were little, to put it in modern words, they were like rules concerning diplomacy and politics. Sansa has not been in a position of power, but the storyline is going towards it. Right now, she's been the pawn of Littlefinger, but she will soon learn to be a player and defeat him (actually, there's a prophecy and everything, said by the Witch of High Heart). Once she defeats him, she will take the power position in which he is right now.
Also, if the TV show serves as an omen, she will have ruling functions in Winterfell
Your confusion towards Sansa is because she is still in the first steps towards this phase of her evolution, but there are quotes here and there pointing in that direction:

Imo Tywin was a better hand to Aerys II (and I think we'll learn, was working with Rhaegar: strongly hinted in the World book) until Aerys threw him out. Aerys threw Tywin out due to ""paranoia"", and I think from the show we can guess that there might have been more behind Aerys II's ""Mad King"" role than ""*mere paranoia*"". 3EC tinkered around some, and 3EC just isn't well-enough explored in canon asoiaf yet.

The point of Hobbits being the saviours is that they have and seek so little power that corruption doesn't work on them as well. The more power one has (and one seeks), the easier one would be swayed and corrupted by the Ring. This is why Gandalf, Lady Galadriel and Aragorn refuse it.

In the winter, through a warzone? That's too contrived, and all for a burning. Stannis is the fake messiah, it makes sense that he'd try to do something messianic and fail terribly. Merely taking Winterfell is too low stakes.


>It makes far more thematic sense for Jon to take Winterfell. 

Except Jon tried to ride South, and paid for it. That he'd do it again, and win this time is repetitive and a bit cheap IMO. 

>One of the largest themes in these books is how we pay for the sins of our parents.

Can you elaborate where else we see these themes (genuinely asking, because I've never thought of it this way before). 

> Now, if Jon or anyone else killed Roose or Walder Frey, then that’d be extremely stereotypical. But Ramsay and the Frey children suffering for the Red Wedding would be the most thematically correct thing for Martin to write. 

That's already happening without Jon. House Bolton is going extinct, and House Frey is looking to get into a succession feud.

>The idea of Nymeria exacting vengeance on House Frey... is not something Martin would write.

I didn't say Nymeria is the one exacting vengeance on House Frey. I just think that she's going to contribute to a few deaths, at least on the group escorting Edmure Tully. 

>Nor is Stannis exacting vengeance on Roose for the Red Wedding.

He isn't. He is fighting against usurpation, and at an even more basic level, because Roose is his enemy's ally. 

The thing, is none of the Stark children so far have exerted vengeance on the parties responsible for the Red Wedding. Tywin died for the fault of abusing his son. For what it's worth, I think the show is right and Roose will also die for underestimating Ramsay.

>Further, just consider the obvious foreshadowing. The very first scene that Martin ever came up with in 1989, where the Starks find the direwolf puppies, has Jon saving their lives. This pretty clearly symbolizes that Jon will save House Stark.

Yup, but why does it mean from Boltons? It's not like Jon saved them from the Lannisters either. There's a bigger, badder threat beyond the Wall, maybe that's where Jon's saving hand will play out?

> Or consider the story of Bael the Bard. It appears to be clear evidence for R + L = J, but there’s also an interesting part about Bael’s son being slain by the Boltons.

Good point, Martin seems to be mixing and matching the ""histories and songs repeat themselves"" motif. Ashara Dayne, Jon's 'suspected' mother, seems to have thrown herself off a tower. Robb is the Stark slain by a Bolton. So the thing is, you can't perfectly apply one historical event to another current event.

>Or consider the original outline by GRRM, in which Tyrion captures Winterfell and develops a bitter rivalry with Jon over Arya, which seems to be a warped version of the current fArya, Ramsay, and Jon relationship.

True, but (A) it never said that Jon defeated Tyrion and won back Winterfell and (B) original Tyrion's current version seems to include Theon as well, while other warping include Sansa who is now the one married to Tyrion.

Greyjoy because Theon is probably my favourite fictional character ever, and all of his other family and their dynamics are just incredibly interesting. Greyjoys just seem to attract trouble and misery wherever they go, and wheter they deal it out or suffer it, plots related to them are always an intruiging read. You couldn't pay me to actually be a member of this house though. Also kraken's are pretty neat.

Then you have the Martells, who are just everything I like and want to be. The dornish in general value not only bravery and strength but also intelligence and cunning, they don't discriminate against bastards and women, they're unaplogeticly bisexual and polyamorus and they have a set of ideals and moral standings that they actually stick to unlike most other houses. They're frickin badasses, being the only kingdom that wasn't conquered but married into the seven kingdoms, and they have a great set of diverse characters too. You've got scholars and fighters and diplomats and characters who are all of those things combined *cough* OBERYN *cough* and they're all  proud of their differences from the rest of Westeros which I fucking love. Also Sunspear seems like a pretty sweet place to live, and imo Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken are the best house words by far. With that being said, I will never forgive the showrunners for completely fucking them up after Oberyn's death, especially Ellaria (what the fuck were they thinking giving the generic revenge plot line to the person who was all for NOT TAKING REVENGE???)

And then there's the Tyrells, and I think what I like about them the most is their thematic purpose in the story. They seem to represent one side of the 'coin' of power, with Lannisters being their counterpart. Because while the Lannisters get their power through inspiring fear, strict enforcement, and waging war, the Tyrells manage to get on an eqeal level of power through garnering the love of the people, acts of kindness and diplomatical games. Both houses have power and wealth, and both houses manage this through manipulation, but the way the Tyrells pull it off is a lot more deceptive and subtle and sympathetic towards others, and probably more effective in the long run. And when you think about it the Tyrell rose is very representative of that, as in they present themselves as pretty and sweet and harmless, but they do have thorns underneath. Also Margaery's pretty rad, Loras deserves better, and Highgarden too seems like a cool place to live.

That couldn't be further from the truth. I am looking for a story that can grow naturally from the characters' experiences and motivations, only I try to look at all the characters combined, rather than two characters gravitating towards one event.

Cersei and Jaime both have personal, individual story threads that they do not share through their twincest. Jaime has his internal conflict about honor, his love and guilt towards Tyrion, his vow to Catelyn and his relationship to Brienne. Cersei has her self-hatred for being born a woman, her lust for power, her love for her children, the ego that makes her unable to learn from her mistakes, the use of her sexuality to get what she wants and Maggy's prophecy.

Cersei is not drawn into any of Jaime's personal plot lines, so it is, at best, excessive, to expect Jaime to be drawn into one of Cersei's, the one about Maggy the Frog. Even though he would ""fit"", his own development doesn't seem to pull him in that direction. In any case, the valonqar being Jaime would be about as obvious as a modern Disney villain and as cheesy as south-american soap opera, so I fail to see why people are so adamant that *it* *absolutely must happen*, to the point of downvoting me into oblivion for suggesting a fresh theory on the matter :))",1,asoiaf,1535587334.0

I agree that there's no real argument for peace being an achievement of Jon Arryn. For one thing, there WAS a war, with Greyjoy's rebellion, and it ended on very generous terms to Balon. Plus, there were no transitions of power in any of the seven kingdoms the entire time Jon was in power. Hoster Tully, Ned Stark, Tywin Lannister, Mace Tyrell, Doran Martell, Balon Greyjoy, and Renly Baratheon — plus Jon himself — kept their seats the entire time. That's a remarkable run of stability, and a good way to keep everyone out of trouble. 

The economy of the *realm* was good, although there were fiscal problems in the capital. There's a limit to what the government could do to encourage prosperity in this context; Jon couldn't control the weather. The avoidance of war was at least something, though, and he didn't institute painful levels of taxation. So that's good. 

Littlefinger's embezzlement and corruption was a problem Arryn ignored, but overall, it seems like the income side of the ledger is doing well in his time. But Arryn couldn't rein in the king's spending, for better or worse. No idea if he could have if he tried, though.

I'll give him something of a pass on the rising influence of Lannister power. The Lannisters paid the bills, after all, and he had limited ability to push them back. Janos Slynt wasn't a Lannister, he was just corrupt, and Arryn knew better but couldn't push him out. That's a problem.

Littlefinger was ostensibly a vassal of House Arryn, so while it was wrong to trust him in the end, I'm not sure it's blameworthy. Pycelle, as Grand Maester, couldn't be removed. Varys is a tough call.",30,asoiaf,1535586040.0

Jaime already abandoned Cersei, if you like that idea, he's still partly responsible no matter what her end is. Just let the man have his own story.

Also, no offense, but you lack imagination if you think other options would be less memorable.

Personally I'll always like Jon Snow because we were put in similar situations and he handled it in a much more brave and honorable way.

When I was 17 I took a job about an hour away from my hometown and worked with a bunch of other kids my age who I didn't know. I got paired with a guy who was like Samwell Tarly (overweight, nerdy, etc) He was an okay worker, the job wasn't too difficult but required a lot of walking, which he did but was obviously struggling a little.

Lunch time rolls around and we're sitting at a picnic table with 2 other kids who just start ripping into this guy, making fun of him, threatening to kick his ass, tripping him when he walks by, all kinds of asshole-ery. And I just sat there and let it happen.

I never really thought much about what I could have done. I felt bad, of course, but I rationalized it all kind of ways. I didn't want to risk my job starting a fight, he should have stood up for himself, plus I had been bullied like that before and nobody stood up for me, so I guess he deserved it.

Then a few years later I read Game of Thrones, and the way Jon Snow stood up for Samwell Tarly was just so simple and easy that I looked back on myself and realised I was just a coward. I knew what was the right thing to do and I did nothing because it was safer and easier, but Jon Snow just did what was right.

There were debts and LF was cooking the books, but there was enough money that the Kingdom was still running smoothly compared to earlier or later years.  There was one minor-ish war, the Iron Islands, that was fairly quickly squashed.  He kept the Martells from raising hell.  

His biggest mistake was letting the Lannisters gain a foothold after they alienated the Martells and the smallfolk with all the rape and murder and not closely tying in the Reach (he had no way of knowing that they wouldn't be planning with Viserys in Essos, even with a Florent marriage to Stannis).  Tywin would have been beyond pissed that Cersei wasn't Queen, but he would have been kept from revolting if Jaime was let out of the KG.  Robert should have married one of the Tyrell sisters or a Hightower, therefore tying in a Loyalist region that has the biggest agricultural output and almost as money as the Westerlands.  Marriages with high born reach girls to the Vale and the Riverlands, perhaps even Edmure (if Cersei doesn't marry him), could have further entwined the regions.  Stannis could have married a rebel Stormlands house to reward the rebels, and marriages to Rebel houses daughters could have been promised to Robert and Stannis's sons for further reward (perhaps even rebuilding Summerhall). If Cersei didn't marry Edmure, Jaime could have been arranged to be married off to a Royce or a very high level Stormlands house, like Robert's Estermont cousins, if they wanted him out of the KG.  Renly should have been married off to a Targ Loyalist house from the Crownlands and given Dragonstone.

A Reach—Stormlands—North—Arryn—Vale alliance would have been near unbreakable.  The only possible danger would be Dorne and the Westerlands, and those two would never pair up after what happened to Elia, and Dorne might calm down slightly since Cersei isn't queen (that was like salt rubbed in their wound).

e51d8jb,">Battle of the Bastards is an excellent example - as a battle episode it's brilliant technically, but so much of what happens makes so little sense.  Piles of bodies dozens of feet high, the encirclement happening with impossible precision and without any attempt at disruption, the Rohirrim Knights of the Vale appearing in the North unscouted and without accounting for Moat Cailin, the tons of Ramsay-betrayal setup that was never paid off, etc.  The writing is basically the only thing that detracts from an otherwise perfect episode.

I think the writing is excatly what made this episode look like this, otherwise, if you wanted to have everything make sense then it wouldn't have the same dramatic effect. In order to have that ""Rides of Rohan"" charge you need to dumb-down the entire sequence. Example? Battle of Blackwater, just because Martin saying that they killed all the scouts, doesn't make it less unbeliveable. If you wanted this battle to make most sense then Stannis would know about Tywin coming to rescue. But it wouldn't hold the same dramatic effect, entire battle would unfold differently as a result. 

And the same goes for Battle of the Bastards episode. It is perfect because its dumbed down, otherwise for me there would be too much elements interrupting something that is suppose to be climatic battle. 

Thing about pacing might be right, i just used an example.   
Bad thing for one is good thing for another. Elio and Linda hate when D&D change things from the books, but at the same time changes from the books are something that allows the show to go on for so long.

DragonDemands might hate when D&D write a scenes and plots to showcase the actor abilities, but the industry loves it. 

Also, there is something that we completely miss when discussing the matter of writing in television that is budget and production time, something that Martin doesn't care about. And if show wants to reach the same conclusion as the books then it makes things indefinitely harder to write. Not saying they're perfect, but they still do really well as writers and showrunners.

And it can't be a situation where Cersei herself is threatening someone's life (like Lysa was threatening Sansa), because strangling her would take some time, and at that point she's either in custody and no longer in a position to hurt that person, or can hurt them anyway (say, with the prick of a poison needle) and will do so even as she dies.

Cregan Stark signed ""the pact of ice and fire"" to trade Stark loyalty in the civil war for a Targaryen princess. Once that was done, Cregan changed his mind and wanted Alysane Blackwood instead. The only reason I can think: that skinchangers can recognize each other. He saw in House Blackwood the magic that had disappeared from the Targaryen line. 

Lord Blackwood schemed to get his offspring to mate with the Targaryens. Then Aegon IV mated with as many Blackwood/Bracken women as he could get his hands on. Of a Blackwood was Bloodraven born and became the most powerful sorcerer we know of so far. Then Egg marries a Blackwood and her direct descendant hatches dragon eggs. Their other descendant is Jon Snow. There are probably Blackwoods in Catelyn's line, seeing as they are Tully bannermen. 

Another Melantha Blackwood marries William Stark and Ned and Bran and Jon and Arya are her descendants. 

Most magical characters in Westeros trace their lineage to house Blackwood. It is my theory that House Blackwood were the last and purest breed of ""magical/telepathic/skinchanging/greenseeing"" individuals that others needed to breed with to fulfill prophecy.

Furthermore, we don't even know if she was the Knight of the Laughing Tree—that's a fan assumption. Could have even been BenJen as he was there at the tourney, and it's sort of impossible to imagine a 14 year old girl (she likely didn't have the muscle and strength, she wasn't trained like Arya) beating fully trained squires and knights.

The ""rescue"" makes zero sense. Why would he not have the trusted, beloved Arthur go rescue her instead of himself if that was factual?  Instead, he puts himself in danger and looks even more suspicious to his already paranoid father by riding off....and he leaves his wife and kids alone.  It also doesn't take five plus months to journey to Dorne so the timeline is all off.  

And even if it was an arranged marriage, he owed Elia some basic respect.  Fucking another women in her homeland, while thousands of Dornishmen died, is not showing respect. It's not the affair, it's the incredibly tacky way they went about the affair with full knowledge of how dangerous the Blackfyre situation was, etc.  A crown prince having an affair is not the same as a Mallister having an affair due to the potential consequences with mistresses, etc.  it'd be like if Prince William was caught having an affair with a politician when everyone knows the British Royalty is not supposed to interfere with the government at all—it could lead to the downfall.

But as he goes along and the pieces start coming together, he has to do tons of other work to make it all fit.

Additionally, he's said multiple times that he doesn't want to split TWOW, which means that he's probably at a point where he has more than enough pages and words written to publish the book, but he's written more than can fit into one volume, and the point where 1 volume would end is not a satisfactory ending to TWOW in his view.

TLDR: I just view her youth as making her bad choices more understandable, but not relieving her of all responsibility.

The characters — much ""darker"" than the show. Not necessarily ""worse"", just more interesting/grayer, and you'll find Jon's path isn't quite as cut-and-dried ""heroic"" as the show portrays Jon. Pay attention to Old Nan, Bran, and ...well, I've reread the first three books the most (they're my legit faves, and ASOS, the third one, was pretty much **everyone's** favorite for a long time — for very good reasons! You'll see! Worth the price of admission!).

Not that the last two (DanceDragon) are crap; they're not. They just haven't been finished and the show surpassed them and imo **the show went WAY off the GRRM path in S4/S5.** (We won't know HOW far off until TWOW get published, though).

Also, keep in mind the timeline, as it's canon different. The book characters are MUCH younger which gives asoiaf more of the ""fantasy"" air that GRRM was going for. **You really have to try to scrub the actors (who I mostly love!) from your mind while reading.** I've reread sorta countless times now, and even as a reader-first, I noticed during re-reads I was shifting from ""canon appearances"" in the books to ""show appearances"" and ages. The show sort of messed up my views on the book characters. (Very sad.) Eg, Dany's young! Bran's a TOT **and remains younger than Isaac (Bran actor) throughout.** So you've really got to try to block the show actors out.

It *should* be easier by ASOS, but that's coming from a reader-first. Keep us updated on how you do into ASOS. ASOS is a BRAIN TREAT! Huge, but still a page-turner (you'll get through it faster than AGOT, and I legit love ASOS/AGOT!)",2,asoiaf,1535579168.0

________________________________________________________________________
Also, these quotes from GRRM:

>The battle between Good and Evil is a theme of much of fantasy. But I think the battle between Good and Evil is fought largely within the individual human heart, by the decisions that we make. It’s not like evil dresses up in black clothing and you know, they’re really ugly. These are some of the things that Tolkien did; he made them work fabulously, but in the hands of his imitators, they become total clichés. I mean the orc-like creatures who always do dress in black and... they’re really ugly and they’ve got facial deformities or something. You can tell that if somebody’s ugly, he must be evil. And then Tolkien’s heroes are all very attractive people and all that, of course, again this became cliché in the hands of the Tolkien imitators.

Showrunners: We now go into the final season of our television show after almost a decade with no idea why these ~~Others~~ White Walkers are coming south, destroying the wall and killing all in their wake.

Cersei has no claim, no army (GRRM spends the entirety of AFFC/ADWD weakening Lannister forces) and no public support (that''s the whole point of the walk of shame, it's not just a punishment, it's Cersei being stripped of her power).

Also, GRRM sets up the conflict between Dany and Aegon. And it would make sense to have it over the Iron Throne. And given Aegon's role in the story - stealing Dany's fate and becoming Targaryen conqueror from the Easts who came to bring justice before Dany gets a chance, it makes sense for GRRM top have him defeating the Lannister regime.  And this is the conflct that's been set up by the end of ADWD. Aegon is the one coming for the throne, not Cersei. He is the one who has the Golden Company, not Cersei. He is Dany's foil, not Cersei.

And also GRRM is not as shallow as to have an evil queen in dark clothes teaming up with a super evil king against our protagonist.

My overarching theory is that of an [Exodus to Essos](https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/94t2r6/spoilers_extended_a_fleet_to_carry_the_free_folk/), where Westeros will be taken by the Others, Dany will remain in Essos, and Euron's main goal will be to pick off refugees on the Narrow Sea, perhaps with some occult purpose in mind (seas of blood and all that).

I agree with your comments on some of the other threads that he is a greenseer and he knows that the Others are coming. He knows that Westeros has no chance, and that's why he thinks he can do anything he pleases, to the point of trying to become a god, because nobody will be left to stop him.

That doesn't mean his plot will be all magic, just like Dany's plot isn't all magic. He still needs to indulge his ironborn and conquer lowly island holdfasts and castle, go after grapes before going after dragons, etc. What does he have to lose from a stint on the Iron Throne? It would be a boon to his image, and he could enjoy himself while he's at it. I fully expect him to abandon it when it comes to a siege, and Cersei will have no choice at that point but to follow him on the Silence.

I ultimately see Euron as a villain for Sansa, as he reaves on the Narrow Sea and the people of the Vale finally decide they should pack up and leave Westeros as well.

Tell me another thing, since we agree Euron is a major player for the final arc of the series, what PoVs do we have to show us what he's doing?

Henry VIII got an annulment only after he started his own church and established the divine right of kings in England. His allies were still offended. Rhaegar doesn't have these options at this point due to his own actions. Targaryens weren't absolute monarchs at this point, especially since the dragons were gone. They can't just do whatever they want, as Aegon V's reign and Robert's Rebellion clearly show. Besides, the Faith didn't really like their incestuous marriages anyway. Power plays involving the Faith and at least three Great Houses dictate here that whatever it is that Rhaegar planned, an annulment is going to be extremely difficult to get. Capable rulers might be able to still navigate through this shitstorm, but everything points to Rhaegar being incredibly incapable of overseeing even the most logical consequences of his actions. Aerys' madness and antics complicate this matter even more. 

Yeah you're right about you being engaged in thought exercises. I'm just pointing out that, with what we know about Rhaegar and what happened, about ASOIAF history, about available options etc., his actions are extremely stupid, arrogant, reckless and callous at best.

Tywin takes full credit for and flaunts atrocities like the castamere incident, while roose seems to distance himself from the red wedding. Its because tywin is insecure about the lannister image and wants to seem strong, while roose seems to somewhat get that you dont get far by being feared and seen as violent/unfair (he also chides ramsay for being so obviously brutal).

Tywin lets his life be dictated by his personal feelings, while roose seems to keep such thoughts to himself and tries to have a more objective outlook as far as his actions are concerned. I think roose' downfall will be that he didnt succeed in that, either because he was too objective and forgot others' feelings, or because he made some mistakes out of personal motivation (ramsay, the red wedding) that start to pile up",5,asoiaf,1535568970.0

I actually think you are reducing Euron because of Euor belief that what we saw in the show happen in the books.   


There are two problems with that though:  


It doesn't fit with where Cersei is going in the books. The Lannister story past ASOS is teh story of decay and downfall. Symbolized by Tywin's rotting corpse poisoning the air around him.   


He build this empire for the children, and not it's falling. Cersei is shamed and stripped of her power. Her children are doomed. Lannister forces are frowing weaker and weaker, due to what is happening on dragonstone and in riverlands. The alliences with Freys and Tyrells are falling. It all goes downhill.  


Cersei becoming the queen like in the show is not only logically impoissible (no army, ni public support and Cersei herself holds no authority after her walk) but also goes against the themes of the story. 

&#x200B;

Both Jaime and Cersei are now prisoners of religious groups who want to judge them for their crimes. The alinces they build are falling and their regime in Riverrun and Kings Landing is about to be overthrown. That's their story for TWOW.   


Now to Euron... His story is a mix of lovecraftian and psycological horror. It's all about Gods, magic, visions... Which is why he is heading to Oldtown. And not just as a short stop before going to Kings Landing, where his story really doesn't belong. No, this city, where glass candles give you visions, Faceles Men, magic books and broken horns from beyond the wall. Euron and Oldtown is a perfect fit.   


Euron and Kings Landing isn't. He is not another high lord who wants ti build a dynasty or get closer to the throne. He is the crow feasting on the graveyard that is Westeros after the war of five kings.   


>How will Jaime's story play out, being sent away by Cersei, refusing to come back to her when she needed him, then having an entire arc with Brienne and LSH, somehow escaping, then returning to KL and somehow building up enough resentment to kill her while she senses nothing?

Cersei as the architect of her own demise works with pretty much anything, as long as her decisions are responsible for creating that situation. The destabilization she caused that ultimately led to her imprisonment by the Faith had nothing to do with her relationship with Jaime.

If she allies herself with Euron she will do so because she dug herself in an impossible situation and still doesn't want to give up power; this very much applies to the aforementioned theme.

On the other side, what many of you are ignoring is that killing Cersei is a very petty and meaningless thing for Jaime to do.

Long story short, we found a retired mechanic who was familiar with that specific transmission and called a retired VW engineer in Germany to see if he had the schematics.

Cersei hating Tyrion all his life because of a prophecy but it turning out to be that it's Jaime = good storytelling,  fitting with Cersei's story of self destruction. She made Jaime the valonqar. She is the architect of her own downfall,  she always is. 

Also,  if you really think Euron is gonna be in Kings Landing in mid winds,  you are for some disappointment. He is moving on another direction and Kings Landing is all about the war with Aegon now. 

That's the thing you don't seem to consider. Euron's story does not belong there. Kings Landing has Cersei and Margary with their trials,  Aegon's arrival and the battle between him and the Tyrells.

Cersei has her own drama with the death of her children 

Euron,  meanwhile,  is all about visions,  magic,  supernatural horror. His story belongs on Oldtown,  because this is what this storyline is about as well:

>“Dragons and darker things,” said Leo. “The grey sheep have closed their eyes, but the mastiff sees the truth. Old powers waken. Shadows stir. An age of wonder and terror will soon be upon us, an age for gods and heroes.”

The FM don't let themselves be killed for a payment, they do the killing. They're not going to give some random blonde girl a different face only for her to end up dead.

LF had no future, not after he tried to play the Stark sisters off against each other. He had nowhere else to go because he'd also broken a promise to Cersei and she'd have had his head if he'd turned up in KL. Robyn Arryn would have seen him fly through the Moon Door for killing his mother.

2 - All we know is it was in a language he didn’t understand. Not sure if that narrows it down or not but It’s been mentioned a few times in the show so I think it’ll have some significance. 

3 - My guess is he will save an important character, otherwise his story is pretty pointless. I’m going with Arya. 

4 - No I don’t think so , I think it was just to show he broke the spell on the cave and can affect Bran in their visions. 

5 - I think Howland was sent by the 3ER to save Ned at the ToJ. If he hadn’t, Bran would never have been born and Bran is the key to defeating the NK.

Season 5 is around where they ran out of book material and it's apparent.

Tyrion as Dany's Hand is night and day compared to Tyrion as Joffrey's Hand. He's the most intelligent person in the books, and is made into a bumbling idiot on the show (Dany never listens, he fails at Castlery Rock, proposes bringing back a WW, etc.).",4,freefolk,1535611734.0

More then anything I defend the way they had Littlefinger executed by the Stark Siblings in a closed trial like event however, I do agree that it was more than necessary to have at least two or three more scenes with either both girls or all 3 Stakes meeting and discussing Littlefinger and how he’s got to go. I guess they did it for the shock value not like anyone would believe Arya was about to be executed with both her weapons on and not in chains.

Then when Cersei is waiting before Dragonpit, Cersei asked why ""she"" wasn't with them.  And then Cersei gave orders for UnGregor to kill Tyrion, Dany, and Jon (which wouldn't make sense if she was just asking why Dany wasn't there yet).  Then Cersei later tells Jamie that the GC are going to get stuff back for Cersei - she could have meant the 7K as well as Sansa, whom she hates and does blame for Joffrey's death.

I don’t think she could have kept the Vale loyal to her without all this. She even explains this to Arya, saying you can’t just cut off heads, you have to keep allies to work together.

e524i40,"I get your line of thinking but in terms of GoT//HBO success I just don’t see this happening. My main reason is because of the time constraint. The whole last season will more or less be completely focused on the Night King and Cersei as major endgame advisories to the entire realm. Also as a TV show and entertainment for a large and diverse crowd ie not necessarily book reading, Mythology loving nerds like us I don’t see the majority of the audience being able to follow such a complicated ending. They would have to painstakingly explain this situation coming to fruition. With that being said beyond anything else they’ve built Jonerys up to be the major character development. These two will have sort of tragedy together. Even if both die which is probably unlikely the next best successor is either Sansa or Tyrion to lead the people. D&D have done nothing to focus on Gendry and the actor himself isn’t very standoutish. I just don’t see this happening as per the show. It wouldn’t sit well with like 90% of the viewers. People would literally rewatch the entire series and collectively see like maybe 20 lines and 2 hours of screen time from Gendry. It wouldn’t be bittersweet it’d be ridiculous.

She hasn’t planned for the winter ie grain/food after the loot train. She alienated herself from having any advisers, Qyburn is a servant not an adviser. She pushed Jaimie away who’s not only her lover but the general of her armies. 

Tywin would’ve allied with the Tyrells. He would’ve never allowed the fanatics into the capital. The entire demise of the Tyrell family would’ve never happened. Making strong connections with them via Tommen/Margery was the best thing for the Lannisters as a House. He would’ve been the real King making Tommen do whatever he bid. I think he would’ve sent Tyrion to Winterfell with Sansa to become Warden of the North. The North would’ve rallied behind Sansa/Tyrion especially if he made them help gain back their holdfasts via the Boltons. He would’ve had Roose Bolton destroy Stannis’s army and given him some other reward for handing over Winterfell to Tyrion.  The North was in turmoil because the Ironborn had attacked all their holdfasts and castles so if the Boltons via Tyrion helped win them back the North would’ve supported Tyrion via Sansa in Winterfell. As far as Daenerys is concerned he would’ve probably brought the fight to her. Why wait? She landed on Dragonstone and did nothing. She wouldn’t have had the Tyrells behind her. The Martels probably wouldn’t have killed Marcela so they probably would’ve still had a fragile alliance with the Lannisters. Daenerys would’ve sailed to Westoros with just Yara//Theon.

e521983,"Well Aegon is kind of Varys' masterplan, he has supposedly been raising him to be a perfect ruler. He is at least important to make Varys' motivation in the plot make sense.

I like Penny as well. In the last book Tyrion is depressed, nihillistic, full of self pity and kind of an asshole, Penny, as well as a ton of stuff that happens in that storyline is to show Tyrion how lucky he is that he was born a Lannister and to humble him a bit. But that wasnt really necessary in the show since the show portrays him as having a heart of gold.",2,freefolk,1535602667.0
e52191z,"It was contrived drama. Good drama happens when smart characters make smart, logical choices to try and solve their problems and get what they want in opposition to each other. It's especially bad when the solution to their problems is staring them in the face and it apparently never occurs to them to use it. The WORST drama is when characters have a problem (Littlefinger) and have an obvious solution right there (Bran and his knowledge of Littlefinger's schemes which he apparently already has), but the characters don't recognize/think to check in with their psychic brother and for some reason he never decides to mention it, only to finally play that card at the end of the season even though it was the blatantly obvious solution ever since Bran arrives at Winterfell.

Add on top of that that the supposed tension never felt real to start with, and felt completely out of character. Arya and Sansa love each other, and the hamfisted attempt to leverage their sibling bickering from S1 into murderous intent was just an impossible sell, so those scenes felt really thin. It was the showrunners telegraphing a punch that we knew they'd never throw, especially since any thinking person could clearly see the Bran writing on the wall. 

So instead of a ""What's going to happen next??"" it became a ""So... is Bran gonna tell these two irrational fuckwits what he knows or what? What's he waiting for? I guess that's not the direction the writers are taking this because it's too obvious??""

Then of course, that is exactly what happens. One of the hallmarks of poor plot conflict is if it could be resolved by two characters in close proximity simply sharing information, especially if it would be in their character to do so. You see it ALL THE TIME in bad TV and books, and the show had previously been really great at never ever doing that.

Littlefinger's character was also beloved for his quick thinking and masterminded scheming, yet he has no counter move prepared when a crippled boy claiming to be psychic accuses him of some shit. There were no surprises in that plot whatsoever, and in fact there wouldn't have even been a conflict at all if they didn't feel the need to close Littlefinger's arc in a 7 episode season. It bears all the hallmarks of sloppy, expedited writing with surface-level drama that doesn't actually make sense or provide any satisfaction.",2,freefolk,1535602663.0

e5200ll,"The Arya/Sansa conflict was real.

Arya remembers how Sansa betrayed her/Mycah and her smiling on the podium etc. and grew up with Sansa being considered totally untrustworthy (the oft repeated ""don't tell sansa"").

After arriving in winterfell and to her disappointment finding Sansa in charge instead of Jon, Arya does a couple of reads of Sansa. She correctly reads Sansa is not really a teamplayer. (And this could be seen throughout seasons 6 and 7 if you check the different Sansa/Jon interactions).

In addition she sees some lords preparing treason and Sansa reacting very mildly to this. (Which is exactly how it would look if you were planning actual treason, you don't overthrow Jon the first lord you get on your side, you start to see what you can offer other lords instead). She also sees Sansa under the influence of LF, and someone like Sansa under the influence of LF is dangerous if she is not loyal.

Arya takes it upon herself to push Sansa to be loyal (or if that does not work... maybe ""Sansa"":s face will be loyal at least).

This is where Littlefinger enters, and reinforces this perception for Arya, making the situation seem much more acute (and Sansa seem much closer to treason than she actually is). Arya then presents (/threatens) how she isn't happy with Sansa, and that she have the means of pegging Sansa:s status down a few steps using the letter should she find it necessary.

Sansa then gets rid of Brienne (who would act if \_any\_ of the sisters would act against each other... for example if Sansa were to have Arya arrested).

Then Sansa tries to steal the letter back but gets caught by Arya while investigating the faces. During the ""game of faces"" in the room a number of things happen:

\- Arya clearly states her concern (""is there someone else you think should rule the north instead of him"")

\- Arya informs Sansa that if Arya wanted her dead, not only would Sansa already be dead, noone would be the wiser and ""Sansa"" would still go around in winterfell giving orders (presumably acting in a more Jon-loyal way now...)

\- Arya performs her ""read"" of how far Sansa is gone and decides she's not too far gone. Hands Sansa the knife as a ""baton of power"" indicating ""your move"", and ""please do the right thing"".

The next thing is Sansa:s meeting with Littlefinger. My interpretation is that Sansa, on reflection of what happened in Arya:s room, heard the message from Arya loud and clear and is in the meeting simultaneously testing and playing littlefinger. She is sort of, ""if I pretend to be open to almost any suggestion from him, what will he tell me to do?"". Littlefinger bites the bait and answers with, essentially: ""kill Arya, overthrow Jon, quickly"".

I think Sansa has her real ""holy shit"" moment, ""he's actually pushing me all the way there, we need to get rid of him"". My headcanon is that the scene that was cut (Sansa going to Bran for help) was not so much Bran saving Arya from being gutted on Sansas order, but more about Sansa needing help with getting the proper allegations/proofs against Littlefinger, in order to not become enemies with the Vale (and maybe even keeping support of their soldiers) when executing him.

e51wmxj,"Give it a shot.  We all assume that Jon Arryn was hunting down Robert's bastards because Ned assumed it...but Ned was wrong about a lot of his investigation.  The Lannisters never murdered him.

Furthermore, we don't know what Jon Arryn was investigating about the Lannisters at first or what triggered his suspicion in them.  We also don't know how he discovered Gendry and if it was just at random in a city if over a million people.

What we do know:
1. Robert was hunting when Cersei was giving birth
1. Jon Arryn only asked Gendry about how he likes his living arrangement and about his mother.
1. Gendry's mom was no longer around when he was very little, and she was blonde.

I propose Arryn tracked/had the Lannister's tracked when Jaime was getting his brand new armour just before the story begins.  He discovers Jaime checking up with the blacksmith on how Gendry is doing.  Jon Arryn begins inquiring with Gendry if he is being treated well.  In the books, Gendry's mom was a tavern wench who used to come and go until she died/disappeared; Cersei used to go about the city in disguise as a tavern wench.

Gendry being a legitimate Baratheon/Lannister child 1) saves one (or two depending in outcome) ancient and Noble house(s) from extinction, 2) makes him feel worthy of loving Arya, 3) Makes him the most eligible claim for the throne should Jon and Dany die/become incapacitated/abdicate and walk away from ruling.  It also satisfies the trope of the hidden prince rising to power and having a respect for said power and how it reflects on the common people.  If he comes to rule the entire realm, it satisfies that trope without becoming overly obvious and cliche as Jon doing so.  It would also be consistent with the reader not having POVs of King characters.",1,freefolk,1535598909.0

> IHW: We actually did a scene that clearly got cut, a short scene with Sansa where she knocks on Bran’s door and says, “I need your help,” or something along those lines.

Cersei did get pregnant by Robert once, but she aborted the kid and after that, made sure to not get pregnant from him again. Even says it in her character wiki. 
*""On one occasion, early in her marriage, Cersei became pregnant by Robert. Unwilling to give birth to Robert's child, she sent Jaime out to find a woman to cleanse her. Having grown to resent Robert over the years, Cersei took further care to ensure he did not impregnate her.""*

Thus, no chance in hell that Gendry could be Cersei's child. Just because he says that the woman he remembers as his mom is blonde, doesn't mean its Cersei. I think I also remember him saying that she worked in a tavern or something.

e51r117,"> ""Arya goes really hard at Sansa without real intent. I don't understand why?""

GoT uses many stealthy individuals.  My *theory* is that Arya finally finally got to Winterfell and found her Eden polluted. Having heard Littlefinger scheming in Harrenhal (Season 2), she knew about him and his methods of stirring up Chaos. Now he had Sansa in his grip and had tried to bribe Bran. Unfortunately, he was also protected by Guest Right...unless he harmed his hosts first. So she could not harm him. Bran was too busy with his data mining and could not help, but he did give her LF's dagger. Perhaps as a gift, more likely as a signal.

If you had Faceless Man techniques, would you sit by and let the situation fester? She didn't. Arya went into No One mode to get the job done. She went about it by investigation (of Sansa's motives and LF's actions), insinuation, intimidation and finally communicating to Sansa in a symbolic but effective way that it was her turn to do something about LF. After it was over, Sansa told Arya she was ""the strongest person I know.""  Sansa does not freely give compliments, so you know she finally understood and appreciated whatever Arya had done.

Tyrion advises Aegon to invade Westeros early with the Golden Company to earn Daenerys' respect and then join her, but is kidnapped later on his travels in a brothel by Jorah (like in the show).

She's never had to fess up that she was stupid (though she can make mistakes).  I don't think she fell for it, but even if she did, she used the letter strategically. She got Sansa to her room, left out the Faces and the Dagger and communicated three essential things: literally first--how to play the LIE-detection game, how easy it would be for her to supplant Sansa, and--by handing her the Dagger--that she would NOT do that or harm her.  She walked out, leaving the Dagger, the Faces, her life, and final action against Littlefinger in Sansa's hands.  It was gutsy, but a true vote of confidence because if Sansa sided with LF and brought Arya to trial, she would have had the Faces as evidence.

As to Sansa, she's physically timid though often mentally brave. After her worrisome chat with LF, she apparently went to Bran.

Arya kills Jaqen, Cersei hires Jaqen to kill Sansa and Tyrion. Arya saves them both.

When Viserion is killed he falls into the red keep killing both Cersei & Jaime.

That's scary to think, but considering the other shortcomings of S7, maybe you're right.

Why was S7 so rushed anyway? I know you've answered my first question but I'd like your insight.
For me so much was really rushed.

* Siege of The Rock
* Battle foe High Garden
* The whole thing where the fellowship is waiting for Dany to show up
* What we discussed here about Arya and Sansa 
* Gendry magically reappearing and being ready for a war. Sure he has Baratheon blood but him just locking, loading and bromancing at Jon was kinda cringey

e51nf23,"I believe we see a ""saved by the edit"". Or an attempt to pull a ""saved by the edit"".

Basically, there was supposed to be a scene in the season finale in which Sansa goes to Bran to get him to confirm that LF is a very bad dude. However, the wider implication of that scene would have been that Arya and Sansa were at each other's throats for real the whole time.

And let me tell you, Arya threatening to kill Sansa because of an obviously planted, ancient letter and because Sansa has the ""good Winterfell rooms"", ain't the cutest look. It makes her look dumb, just to begin with. Sansa falling for LF's ""Arya has gone feral and has to be put down"" routine isn't cute either. Basically, if Sansa and Arya didn't plan to pull a fast one on LF, we are pretty close to a character assassination for both of them.

My guess is that some time during the editing process someone did realize that both of them falling for LF's weak-ass manipulation is a shit look and suggested to cut the Bran scene in order to allow the interpretation that all that was just the Starks pretending. They didn't have alternative footage, so they had to make do with the ""they both are each other's throats for serious"" footage.",8,freefolk,1535591352.0

I mean, they haven't had entirely dissimilar lives, and they might actually be in a position to empathize with one another: their parents and brothers were killed, they were both sold into marriage for political alliance to (at least initially) less-than-kind husbands, and they both survived and triumphed after being left with not much in the world besides their wits and their family names.
